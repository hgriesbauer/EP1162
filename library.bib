abstract = {The success of partial cut applications to northern hardwood stands is based upon the contribution of harvested and residual trees to overall stand growth, which can be captured by a stand-level criterion, i.e, the growth dominance coefficient (GDC). The main objective of this study was to test the relevance of GDC in evaluating the success of partial cuts in even-aged and uneven-aged stands that were composed of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.). We first determined whether GDC that was calculated with two indicators of light capture, stem mass and tree leaf area, produced similar results after partial cutting in both stand structures. Second, using linear mixed models, we determined the effect of selection cutting on GDC in uneven-aged stands over the short- and medium-term, and evaluated effects of tree vigour and size before cutting on diameter growth response of trees after cutting. GDC based upon stem mass was similar to GDC based upon tree leaf area in even-aged stands (p = 0.7200), but was lower in uneven-aged stands (p {\textless} 0.001). Selection cutting in uneven-aged stands did not change GDC in the short- (p = 0.7721) and medium- (p = 0.8363) term. Yet, several trees that grew rapidly before cutting responded negatively to partial cutting, while many trees that grew slowly before cutting responded positively. Overall, assessing the success of partial cuts appears to be difficult using GDC, a stand-level criterion. Such assessments, as well as a better understanding of the effects of partial cuts, could be obtained through more detailed growth analyses that are performed at the tree level.},

abstract = {Introduction Relationships between wood density and hydraulic efficiency and safety (hydraulic specific conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation, respectively) could clarify the physiological process explaining the impact of density on fitness. We have used new, relatively high-throughput phenotyping methods to estimate genetic variation of wood hydraulic specific conductivity (k (s)) and vulnerability to cavitation (VC) as an important step toward demonstrating the adaptive value of wood density. Objective The first aim of this study is to test if, in Douglas-fir, there is a relationship between wood hydraulic properties (k (s) and VC) and wood density. The second objective is to estimate genetic variation of wood k (s) and VC. These results could aid understanding of the role of wood density in the hydraulic properties of xylem and may clarify the role of wood density in adaptation to drought. Results Many significant relationships were found between wood density and wood hydraulic properties at clone and tree level, as well as significant genetic variation for k (s) and VC. We have also found positive correlations between tree height, specific conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation, but no relation was found between radial growth and hydraulic variables. Conclusions Our results suggest that wood density has an adaptive value and that microdensity can be used to study adaptation to drought in Douglas-fir. The novel methods used to measure k (s) and VC proved to be interesting alternatives for localized measurement of wood hydraulic properties and were compatible with a robust estimation of genetic variation.},

abstract = {Climate change may lead to alterations in tree growth and carbon cycling. Interpreting the response of forest growth to climate change requires an understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of seasonal climatic influences on the growth of tree species. However, the effects of climate change on pine forest dynamics in tropical region of Thailand remain poorly understood. This study develops three new tree ring-width chronologies of Pinus latteri (Tenasserim pine) in northern and northeastern Thailand and analyzes their climate-growth relationships and temporal stability. Ring-width chronologies of P. latteri at three sites showed significantly positive correlations with precipitation, relative humidity and self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) during the dry season (previous November to current April) and early rainy season (May–June). Conversely, significantly negative correlations were found between ring-width site chronologies and air temperatures (mean, maximum and minimum) from April to August. Therefore, our results revealed that radial growth of Tenasserim pines from northern and northeastern Thailand was mainly limited by moisture availability during the dry-to-wet transition season from April to June. Moving correlations revealed that Tenasserim pines in the lowland area of northeastern Thailand became more sensitive to moisture availability in recent 30 years (1985–2017) as compared with early period (1951–1984). Accompanying the shifted growth sensitivity to climate change, growth synchrony among trees was increasing and tree growth rates of Tenasserim pines have been declining during recent decades at two more moisture-limited sites in northeastern Thailand. Recent rapid warming and increasing drought during the transition season (April–June) together intensify climatic constrains on tree growth of Tenasserim pines in the lowland area of northeastern Thailand. Considering continued regional climate change, pine forests in tropical lowland areas may encounter intensified drought stresses, and thus, become more vulnerable to future climate change. Our results serve as an early indicator of potential effects of climate change on tropical pine species and raise concerns about sustainable managements of pine forests under a changing climate.},

abstract = {Aim Current interest in forecasting changes to species ranges has resulted in a multitude of approaches to species distribution models (SDMs). However, most approaches include only a small subset of the available information, and many ignore smaller-scale processes such as growth, fecundity and dispersal. Further-more, different approaches often produce divergent predictions with no simple method to reconcile them. Here, we present a flexible framework for integrating models at multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian methods. Location Eastern North America (as an example). Methods Our framework builds a metamodel that is constrained by the results of multiple sub-models and provides probabilistic estimates of species presence. We applied our approach to a simulated dataset to demonstrate the integration of a correlative SDM with a theoretical model. In a second example, we built an inte-grated model combining the results of a physiological model with presence– absence data for sugar maple (Acer saccharum), an abundant tree native to eastern North America. Results For both examples, the integrated models successfully included informa-tion from all data sources and substantially improved the characterization of uncer-tainty. For the second example, the integrated model outperformed the source models with respect to uncertainty when modelling the present range of the species. When projecting into the future, the model provided a consensus view of two models that differed substantially in their predictions. Uncertainty was reduced where the models agreed and was greater where they diverged, providing a more realistic view of the state of knowledge than either source model. Main conclusions We conclude by discussing the potential applications of our method and its accessibility to applied ecologists. In ideal cases, our framework can be easily implemented using off-the-shelf software. The framework has wide poten-tial for use in species distribution modelling and can drive better integration of multi-source and multi-scale data into ecological decision-making.},

Techniques for measurement of light in forests such as radiometers, photosensitive paper or chemicals, hemispherical canopy photographs, the plant canopy analyzer, or visual estimators of canopy density are each discussed in terms of their accuracy, costs, ease of use, and conditions required during measurement. Predictive models of light transmission based on canopy architecture are also described in terms of their assumptions, accuracy, and input data costs. Lastly the paper discusses the relationship among overstory and understory densities, ground-level light, and 'windows of opportunity' for regeneration of trees in the understory following management interventions.},

abstract = {A white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) overstory of a 30+ year old stand was thinned or completely removed, releasing an advance regeneration of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt). The overstory was clear-cut (T0), thinned to 600 (T600) or to 1200 (T1200) stems/ha, or left uncut (control). Three years after release, understory responses were best demonstrated by decreasing specific leaf area with increasing release level and by changes to height and radial growth increments. Clear-cutting the overstory stalled the height growth in fir for two seasons and radial growth at the tree base for one season. Compared with the control, the 3-year height increment was proportionally greatest in intermediate trees of T600, and this treatment produced the overall best response in height growth. Complete birch removal produced the best radial growth response despite the initial growth check. However, no release treatment significantly affected the whole tree variables (aboveground biomass, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), live crown ratio) within the studied time frame. Shoot silhouette ratios were lowest in the completely released understory trees, while they were similar to those of the controls in all partial-release treatments. Tree sturdiness (height/DBH ratio) was 80-90 in most treatments except TO, where it declined to below 80. Despite this improvement, large trees in TO have been damaged by wind and snow.},

Fertilization did not affect seedling growth. Furthermore, soil N availability did not vary among harvest treatments. In contrast, clearcut compared with shelterwood seedlings had greater mass (fivefold), light availability (twofold), and soil temperatures (1.6°C). Across harvest treatments, spruce and fir mass increased linearly to 100{\%} open-sky light (R2 = 0.51 and 0.57, respectively), and temperature and light combined explained more variation in mass than light alone (adjusted R2 = 0.58 for both species). Spruce growth was more sensitive to temperature than fir in both field and greenhouse experiments. Diminished growth at low soil temperature was associated with lower photosynthesis and not lower leaf fraction. Thus, soil temperature and light colimit seedling growth in subalpine forests, but responses were species-specific and consistent with microenvironment differences in spruce and fir regeneration niches.},

abstract = {The valleys of southwestern Yukon have a continental climate with average annual precipitation of {\textless}300 mm. In 1958, fires burned large areas of mature mixedwood forests dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) in the valleys near Whitehorse. Since then, the burned areas have shown poor regeneration of spruce, but have been colonized by scattered clones of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) interspersed by grassland. The objective of the study was to examine the influence of climatic variation on forest growth and regeneration in the 1958 burn and the adjacent unburned forests. Tree-ring analysis was conducted on 50 aspen and 54 white spruce in 12 mature stands where these species were codominant, and on 147 regenerating aspen in the 1958 Takhini burn. The mature stands were uneven-aged and the patterns of growth variation for the aspen and spruce between 1944 and 2000 were similar. Growth of both species was most strongly related to variation in precipitation. The regenerating aspen had a wide age-class distribution (1959-2000) and their growth was also positively related to precipitation. The results indicate that these forests have been slow to regenerate after fire, and are vulnerable if the climate becomes drier under future global change. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

abstract = {Given the widespread ecological implications that would accompany any significant change in evaporative demand of the atmosphere, this study investigated spatial and temporal variation in several accepted expressions of potential evaporation (PE). The study focussed on forest regions of North America, with 1 km-resolution spatial coverage and a monthly time step, from 1951-2014. We considered Penman's model (EPen), the Priestley-Taylor model (EPT), 'reference' rates based on the Penman-Monteith model for grasslands (ERG), and reference rates for forests that are moderately coupled (ERFu) and well coupled (ERFc) to the atmosphere. To give context to the models, we also considered a statistical fit (EPanFit) to measurements of pan evaporation (EPan). We documented how each model compared with EPan, differences in attribution of variance in PE to specific driving factors, mean spatial patterns, and time trends from 1951-2014. The models did not agree strongly on the sensitivity to underlying drivers, zonal variation of PE, or on the magnitude of trends from 1951-2014. Sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit (Da) differed among models, being absent from EPT and strongest in ERFc. Time trends in reference rates derived from the Penman-Monteith equation were highly sensitive to how aerodynamic conductance was set. To the extent that EPanFit accurately reflects the sensitivity of PE to Da over land surfaces, future trends in PE based on the Priestley-Taylor model may underestimate increasing evaporative demand, while reference rates for forests, that assume strong canopy-atmosphere coupling in the Penman-Monteith model, may overestimate increasing evaporative demand. The resulting historical database, covering the spectrum of different models of PE applied in modern studies, can serve to further investigate biosphere-hydroclimate relationships across North America.},

abstract = {The long-term effects of high-intensity diameter-limit cuttings conducted in the winter and summer of the 1940s and 1950s on the dynamics of softwood and mixedwood stands in southeastern Quebec were compared. Changes in composition and stand structure over a 50 year period were studied using 18 permanent sample plots located in the Lac-M{\'{e}}tis Seigneury observation area measured in 1950, 1960, 1970, and 2003. Winter logging operations were conducted between 1942 and 1949, and summer logging operations were conducted between 1958 and 1960. The interaction between cuttings and the 1950s and 1970s spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)) outbreaks that occurred in the area affected forest dynamics. For the two logging operation types, the most abundant softwood species observed before logging and in 2003 was balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), whereas white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) were the most abundant hardwood species. Changes in the overstory composition were more significant in the summer logging operations than in the winter ones. The soft-wood cover type observed before winter logging was maintained in 2003. Following summer logging, an important increase in the proportion of birch species was observed. The softwood cover type observed before logging had changed to a mixedwood cover type by 2003. Forest dynamics differences between the two types of logging were the result of interactions between the density and composition of advance regeneration, the microsite conditions after logging, and the length and severity of spruce budworm outbreaks.

abstract = {Local adaptation in tree species has been documented through a long history of common garden experiments where functional traits (height, bud phenology) are used as proxies for fitness. However, the ability to identify genes or genomic regions related to adaptation to climate requires the evaluation of traits that precisely reflect how and when climate exerts selective constraints. We combine dendroecology with association genetics to establish a link between genotypes, phenotypes and interannual climatic fluctuations. We illustrate this approach by examining individual tree responses embedded in the annual rings of 233 Pinus strobus trees growing in a common garden experiment representing 38 populations from the majority of its range. We found that interannual variability in growth was affected by low temperatures during spring and autumn, and by summer heat and drought. Among-population variation in climatic sensitivity was significantly correlated with the mean annual temperature of the provenance, suggesting local adaptation. Genotype-phenotype associations using these new tree-ring phenotypes validated nine candidate genes identified in a previous genetic-environment association study. Combining dendroecology with association genetics allowed us to assess tree vulnerability to past climate at fine temporal scales and provides avenues for future genomic studies on functional adaptation in forest trees.},

Such changes occur slowly and manifest at decadal to century time scales; however, the present benchmark spatial resolution for land cover analysis from oblique repeat photographs, 100 m, is insufficient to analyze anticipated changes in ATE over a century-scale. In this research note, fractional cover classification of the ATE is achieved through oblique photography analysis with the WSL Monoplotting Tool. Seven oblique photographs of the West Castle Watershed (Alberta, Canada), collected by the Mountain Legacy Project, were gridded to a 20-m resolution and assigned canopy cover classes by manual interpretation. Four canopy cover classes (i.e., no cover, low vegetation, partial canopy, full canopy) were compared to lidar-derived fractional cover. The extraction of canopy cover information from oblique photography at a resolution of 20 m introduces the ability to assess and quantify changes in the ATE using century-scale oblique photographic records.},

abstract = {COFECHA is a computer program that assesses the quality of crossdating and measurement accuracy of tree-ring series. Written by Richard L. Holmes in 1982, the program has evolved into one of the most important and widely used in dendrochronology. It is important to note that COFECHA does not perform all the necessary steps in crossdating. Rather, the program is a tool that helps the dendrochronologist assess the quality of crossdating and measurement accuracy. The ultimate decision whether or not a tree-ring series is successfully crossdated must lie with the dendrochronologist and not with the software. Therefore, the program is most useful after initial crossdating is accomplished using visual or graphical techniques (such as skeleton plots), and the rings have been measured. The proper use of COFECHA adds a high degree of confidence that tree-ring samples have been crossdated correctly and measured accurately, ensuring that the environmental signal is maximized. In this paper, I describe the use of COFECHA through all necessary steps, and discuss the meaning of the initial questions posed at program start-up, the various options available in the main menu, the various sections of the output from COFECHA, and interpretation of the diagnostics of crossdating and measurement accuracy. I demonstrate methods used to help crossdate undated series, and offer tips on taking full advantage of the various options available in the program.},

abstract = {Tree ring studies have shown that drought is a major factor governing growth of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests in western Canada. Previous analyses showed that interannual variation in aspen radial growth is moderately well-correlated with a climate moisture index (CMI), calculated annually as the difference between precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PE). However, there are multi-year lags, where current year growth is significantly related to CMI over each of the preceding 5 years. We postulated that such lags arise because of tree growth responses to soil water content, which in deep soils may change slowly in response to interannual variation in P and PE. To address this, a model was developed that simulates changes in a soil moisture index (SMI) from inputs of P and PE only. The SMI represents the quantity of available soil water (mm) for aspen forest evapotranspiration and growth, and also provides a measure of relative soil water content ($\theta$r). Model performance was tested using measurements made at an intensively instrumented boreal aspen stand in Saskatchewan, Canada, over a 9-year period that included an exceptionally severe drought (2001-2003). Following optimization of the equations describing soil water limitations on evapotranspiration, the model was successful in simulating the observed, monthly variation in $\theta$r(r2=0.86-0.88). The model was then used to estimate historic variation in the SMI across a regional network of aspen stands where historical variation in growth was reconstructed from tree-rings. Subsequent analyses showed that average SMI during the current growing season was comparable to the CMI in its ability to explain temporal variation in aspen growth. However, the multi-year lags associated with the CMI were no longer statistically significant when the SMI was used as the independent moisture variable. In a case study of aspen stands that had been free of significant defoliation by insects, tree-ring analysis showed that growth was significantly related to CMI in each of the preceding 5 years, but was significantly related to SMI only in the current year and the preceding year. Thus, hydrological lags can explain much of the apparent delay in aspen growth responses to moisture, and future tree-ring studies may benefit from using modeled SMI as a more realistic index for assessing drought impacts on the productivity of aspen and other forest types. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and ENSO conditional on PDO states were considered in composite analyses of 71 long, high-quality datasets from surface meteorological stations. Month-by-month, station-by-station Monte Carlo bootstrap tests were employed to assess statistical significance. The results trace precipitation and temperature responses as a function of location, season, and climate mode. In summary, temperature responses were relatively uniform, with higher (lower) temperatures during the warm (cool) phases of these circulation patterns. Nevertheless, strength and seasonal persistence varied considerably with location and climate mode. Impacts were generally most consistent in winter and spring but could extend through most of the year. Overall spatiotemporal patterns in precipitation response were decoupled from those in temperature and were far more heterogeneous. Complexities in precipitation signals included north-south inverse teleconnectivity along the Pacific coast, with a zero-response hinge point in the approximate vicinity of northern Vancouver Island; seasonally opposite anomalies in several interior regions, which might conceivably reflect contrasting effects of Pacific climate modes on wintertime frontal storms versus summertime convective storms; and a consistent lack of substantial response in northwestern British Columbia and possibly southwestern Yukon, conjectured to reflect complications associated with the Icefield Ranges. The product is intended primarily as a basic-level set of climate response maps for hydrologists, biologists, foresters, and others who require empirical assessments of relatively local-scale, year-round ENSO and PDO effects across this broad region.[Traduit par la r{\'{e}}daction] Nous avons {\'{e}}valu{\'{e}} les r{\'{e}}percussions de certaines configurations de circulation oc{\'{e}}an Pacifique-atmosph{\`{e}}re cl{\'{e}}s sur les cycles annuels de temp{\'{e}}rature et de pr{\'{e}}cipitations en Colombie-Britannique, au Yukon et dans le sud-est de l'Alaska.

abstract = {Information about the sensitivity to climate of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) is valuable because it will allow forest managers to maximize growth, better understand how carbon sequestration may change over time, and better model and predict future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examined the effects of climatic variability on the growth of Douglas-fir along an elevational gradient in the North Cascade Range, Washington (USA), at annual timescales during the 20th century. Multivariate analysis and correlation analysis were used to identify climate-growth relationships. Mid-elevation chronologies were negatively correlated with growing season maximum temperature and positively correlated with growing season precipitation. In contrast, high-elevation chronologies were positively correlated with annual temperatures and negatively correlated with previous-year winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. Projected increases in summer temperatures will likely cause greater soil moisture stress in many forested ecosystems. The potential of extended summer drought periods over decades may significantly alter spatial patterns of productivity, thus impacting carbon storage. It is likely that the productivity of Douglas-fir in the Cascade Range will decrease at sites with shallow, excessively drained soils, south- and west-facing aspects, and steep slopes and will increase at high-elevation sites. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

Partial cuts significantly increased stomatal conduc-tance of red spruce only. Light-saturated photosynthesis (leaf-area basis) of both species increased with BA removal, but unlike red spruce, specific leaf area (SLA) of balsam fir decreased with increased cutting intensity. Partial cuts appreciably increased the concentration of N and Ca in red spruce and balsam fir foliage, respectively, and resulted in decreased foliar concentrations of K in red spruce and Mg in balsam fir. The height and lateral growth of both species increased with BA removal, although partial cuts were more beneficial to balsam fir. The data suggest that short advance regeneration of red spruce and balsam fir can coexist under partial overstory conditions, but balsam fir has physiological characteristics and a capacity for morphological adjustment (SLA) that places it at an advantage when in competition with red spruce.},

abstract = {Elevational and polar treelines have been studied for more than two centuries. The aim of the present article is to highlight in retrospect the scope of treeline research, scientific approaches and hypotheses on treeline causation, its spatial structures and temporal change. Systematic treeline research dates back to the end of the 19th century. The abundance of global, regional, and local studies has provided a complex picture of the great variety and heterogeneity of both altitudinal and polar treelines. Modern treeline research started in the 1930s, with experimental field and laboratory studies on the trees' physiological response to the treeline environment. During the following decades, researchers' interest increasingly focused on the altitudinal and polar treeline dynamics to climate warming since the Little Ice Age. Since the 1970s interest in treeline dynamics again increased and has considerably intensified from the 1990s to today. At the same time, remote sensing techniques and GIS application have essentially supported previous analyses of treeline spatial patterns and temporal variation. Simultaneously, the modelling of treeline has been rapidly increasing, often related to the current treeline shift and and its implications for biodiversity, and the ecosystem function and services of high-elevation forests. It appears, that many seemingly 'new ideas' already originated many decades ago and just confirm what has been known for a long time. Suggestions for further research are outlined.},

abstract = {Based on data from 102 white spruce-dominated stands in the sub-boreal spruce zone of British Columbia, forest site quality was evaluated using both species-specific and ecological approaches. White spruce site index, determined from stem analysis data, was used as a species-specific measure of site quality. Climate regimes and soil moisture, aeration and nutrient regimes were used as ecological measures of site quality. Subzones and variants, differentiated by zonal vegetation, were used as synoptic measures of climate. Soil moisture regimes, differentiated by actual/potential evapotranspiration ratio, depth to a gleyed layer or prominent mottles, and depth to a groundwater table, were used as synoptic measures of soil moisture. Soil aeration regimes, differentiated by soil water saturation, slope, drainage, and soil texture, were used as synoptic measures of soil aeration. Soil nutrient regimes, differentiated by mineralizable nitrogen (kg ha-1) and carbon/nitrogen ratio, was used as synoptic measures of available soil nutrients. These measures were related to white spruce site index through regression analysis and limiting factor analysis. The results showed that soil moisture, aeration, and nutrients were growth-limiting factors while climatic variations within the sub-boreal spruce zone were not important. The best regression model explained about 90{\%} of the total variance in site index, with standard error of estimates of 1.2 m. This strong relationship suggests that ecological site classifications can be used to evaluate both ecological site quality and forest productivity. {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A comparison of dead and surviving Douglas fir trees following the 2003 drought was made to define proxies of adaptive traits for resistance to drought. Increment cores were sampled from trees from three French regions: Centre, Midi-Pyre´ne´es and Burgundy. Original tree-ring variables were calculated, based on a sliding density criterion dividing the microdensity profile into high- and low-density segments. Tree rings were analysed at each site in a number of consecutive annual rings before the 2003 drought event. Comparison between pairs of surviving and dead trees and between pairs of randomly selected trees (whether dead or alive) supports the evidence of systematic dissimilarities between surviving and dead trees in a number of original density variables. Correlation analysis between original and conventional ring density variables indicates a weak association. We found that the surviving trees were denser than the dead trees in all three sites, but that the denser part of the ring varied from region to region. We identified several original density variables intended to be used as proxies of adaptive traits in future studies of genetic determinism of Douglas fir resistance to drought.},

abstract = {Climate warming is predicted to alter ecological boundaries in high-latitude ecosystems including the elevational or latitudinal extent of tall shrubs in Arctic and alpine tundra. Over 60 studies from 128 locations around the tundra biome have investigated shrub expansion in tundra ecosystems; however, only six studies test whether shrublines are actually advancing up hill-slopes or northward into tundra where tall shrubs are currently absent. We test the hypothesis that willow shrublines have expanded to higher elevations in relation to climate across a 50 × 50 km area in the Kluane Region of the southwest Yukon Territory, Canada by surveying of 379 shrubs at 14 sites and sampling of 297 of the surveyed shrubs at 10 sites. We compared growth and recruitment to climate variables to test the climate sensitivity of shrub increase using annual radial growth analysis, age distributions and repeat field surveys to estimate the current rate of shrubline advance. We found consistent and increasing rates of recruitment of alpine willows, with estimates of faster advancing shrublines on shallower hill-slopes. Mortality was extremely low across the elevation gradient. Aspect, elevation and species identity did not explain variation in recruitment patterns, suggesting a regional factor, such as climate, as the driver of the observed shrubline advance. Annual radial growth of willows was best explained by variation in summer temperatures, and recruitment pulses by winter temperatures. Measured recruitment rates are {\~{}}20 ± 5 individuals per hectare per decade (M ± SE) and measured rates of increased shrub cover of {\~{}}5 ± 1{\%} per decade (M ± SE) measured at the Pika Camp site between field surveys in 2009 and 2013. Our results suggest that shrubline will continue to advance over the next 50 years, if growing conditions remain suitable. However, if future conditions differ between summer and winter seasons, this could lead to contrasting trajectories for recruitment vs. growth, and influence the vegetation change observed on the landscape. Synthesis. Our findings in the context of a review of the existing literature indicate that elevational and latitudinal shrublines, like treelines, are advancing in response to climate warming; however, the trajectories of change will depend on the climate drivers controlling recruitment vs. growth.},

abstract = {Stocking control refers to forest management operations that alter the number and arrangement of trees within a stand and is a central element of uneven-aged silviculture. Many alternative stocking control approaches have been developed for uneven-aged stands. Four methods are presented that represent a contrast in complexity and emphasis, but that conceptually build on each other. All are assumed to be tools for allocation of growing space. The BDq approach builds on a reverse-J diameter distribution that serves as a target stand structure. The Plenter system is similar to the BDq approach as it uses a diameter distribution to represent stand structure but provides more flexibility for structures with different growth patterns. Stand density index can be allocated among diameter classes to form a variety of structures. Similarly, leaf area index can be allocated among age classes or canopy strata without the constraints of a reverse-J diameter distribution. Other methods for controlling stocking in uneven-aged stands exist and many undoubtedly represent sound approaches to management. The trend in the four approaches described here is towards a better understanding of stand dynamics and greater flexibility for diverse structural goals.},

abstract = {This paper reviews aspects of the functional ecology of naturally established tree seedlings in the boreal forests of North America with an emphasis on the relationship between light availability and the growth and survival of shade tolerant conifers up to pole size. Shade tolerant conifer species such as firs and spruces tend to have a lower specific leaf mass, photosynthetic rate at saturation, live crown ratio, STAR (shoot silhouette area to total needle surface area ratio), and root to shoot ratio than the shade intolerant pines. The inability of intolerant species such as the pines and aspen to survive in shade appears to be mainly the result of characteristics at the shoot, crown, and whole-tree levels and not at the leaf level. Although firs and spruces frequently coexist in shaded understories, they do not have identical growth patterns and crown architectures. We propose a simple framework based on the maximum height that different tree species can sustain in shade, which may help managers determine the timing of partial or complete harvests. Consideration of these functional aspects of regeneration is important to the understanding of boreal forest dynamics and can be useful to forest managers seeking to develop or assess novel silvicultural systems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim Treelines occur globally within a narrow range of mean growing season temperatures, suggesting that low-temperature growth limitation determines the position of the treeline. However, treelines also exhibit features that indicate that other mechanisms, such as biomass loss not resulting in mortality (dieback) and mortality, determine treeline position and dynamics. Debate regarding the mechanisms controlling treeline position and dynamics may be resolved by identifying the mechanisms controlling prominent treeline spatial patterns (or form) such as the spatial structure of the transition from closed forest to the tree limit. Recent treeline studies world-wide have confirmed a close link between form and dynamics. Location The concepts presented refer to alpine treelines globally. Methods In this review, we describe how varying dominance of three general first-level mechanisms (tree performance: growth limitation, seedling mortality and dieback) result in different treeline forms, what second-level mechanisms (stresses, e.g. freezing damage, photoinhibition) may underlie these general mechanisms, and how they are modulated by interactions with neighbours (third-level mechanisms). This hierarchy of mechanisms should facilitate discussions about treeline formation and dynamics. Results We distinguish four primary treeline forms: diffuse, abrupt, island and krummholz. Growth limitation is dominant only at the diffuse treeline, which is the form that has most frequently responded as expected to growing-season warming, whereas the other forms are controlled by dieback and seedling mortality and are relatively unresponsive. Main conclusions Treeline form provides a means for explaining the current variability in treeline position and dynamics and for exploring the general mechanisms controlling the responses of treelines to climatic change. Form indicates the relative dependence of tree performance on various aspects of the external climate (especially summer warmth versus winter stressors) and on internal feedbacks, thus allowing inferences on the type as well as strength of climate-change responses.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the evidence and history of glacier fluctuations during the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the Canadian Rockies. Episodes of synchronous glacier advance occurred in the 12th-13th, early 18th and throughout the 19th centuries. Regional ice cover was probably greatest in the mid-19th century, although in places the early 18th century advance was more extensive. Glaciers have lost over 25{\%} of their area in the 20th century. Selective preservation of the glacier record furnishes an incomplete chronology of events through the 14th-17th centuries. In contrast, varve sequences provide continuous, annually resolved records of sediments for at least the last millennium in some highly glacierized catchments. Such records have been used to infer glacier fluctuations. Evaluation of recent proxy climate reconstructions derived from tree-rings provides independent evidence of climate fluctuations over the last millennium. Most regional glacier advances follow periods of reduced summer temperatures, reconstructed from tree rings particularly ca. 1190-1250, 1280-1340, 1690s and the 1800s. Reconstructed periods of higher precipitation at Banff, Alberta since 1500 are 1515-1550, 1585-1610, 1660-1680 and the 1880s. Glacier advances in the early 1700s, the late 1800s and, in places, the 1950-1970s reflect both increased precipitation and reduced summer temperatures. Negative glacier mass balances from 1976 to 1995 were caused by decreased winter balances. The glacier fluctuation record does not contain a simple climate signal: it is a complex response to several interacting factors that operate at different timescales. Evaluation of climate proxies over the last millennium indicates continuous variability at several superimposed timescales, dominated by decade-century patterns. Only the 19th century shows a long interval of sustained cold summers. This suggests that simplistic concepts of climate over this period should be abandoned and replaced with more realistic records based on continuous proxy data series. The use of the term LIA should be restricted to describing a period of extended glacier cover rather than being used to define a period with specific climate conditions.

abstract = {Dendroecological techniques were used in this study to compare the radial growth patterns of different conifer species and to identify regional climatic anomalies and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) outbreaks for the past four centuries in the McGregor Model Forest, central British Columbia, Canada. Tree-ring chronologies of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii vat. glauca (Beissn.) Franco), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca (Moench) Voss) were developed for the Model Forest. Response function analysis showed that (1) Douglas-fir is the most climate sensitive species, and its radial growth is mainly controlled by spring precipitation and early summer temperature, and (2) the ring growth of subalpine fir and spruce is negatively affected by high summer temperature. Comparisons of the tree-ring chronologies among the three species revealed dynamics of growth releases and suppressions which reflected climate variations and forest disturbance patterns in the past several centuries. The climate during the late 1750s-1800s was characterized by slightly moist springs and probably moderate summers. During the late 1860s and early 1870s, the region experienced dry springs, hot summers, and probably cold late falls. This study identified three intervals of major disturbances attributable to severe spruce beetle outbreaks: the late 1720s, 1810s-1820s, and 1960s-early 1980s. These coincided with periods of above average growth in Douglas-fir. The association suggested a possible moist spring-outbreak pattern. The multicentury tree-ring records of climate anomalies and Spruce beetle outbreaks could provide insight into the dynamics of forest growth and its response to environmental changes.},

abstract = {Temperature drives ecosystem function and can be estimated from potential solar irradiation (the surface angle of the Earth in relationship to the sun). However, indirect topographical proxies (i.e., aspect) are often used in lieu of direct temperature estimates; and temperature models based on potential solar irradiation typically omit elevation, a key parameter in temperature estimation. Using temperature data (2002-04) from regional weather stations and field sites in the southern Appalachian region of North Carolina and north Georgia, I test the efficacy of temperature estimations based on potential solar irradiation and present a simple method to improve such estimations by incorporating elevational temperature gradients. The heat load index, which weighs afternoon sun as more integral to heat generation than morning sun, fits actual weather station and field site temperatures better than solar angle alone. However, in all years and data sets, adjusting the heat load index for elevational substantially improves its fit with actual temperatures. Further, by calibrating the adjusted heat load estimation with annual weather station temperature data, actual field site temperature for individual years can be accurately predicted. This paper presents a relatively simple method for generating temperature data that requires only spreadsheet or statistical software. This is useful for estimating temperatures from data sets where only topographical or GPS data were collected. It also can be used to derive missing data when sampling sites outnumber temperature loggers},

abstract = {Rates and spatial patterns of tree mortality are predicted to change during forest structural development. In young forests, mortality should be primarily density dependent due to competition for light, leading to an increasingly spatially uniform pattern of surviving trees. In contrast, mortality in old-growth forests should be primarily caused by contagious and spatially autocorrelated agents (e.g., insects, wind), causing spatial aggregation of surviving trees to increase through time. We tested these predictions by contrasting a threedecade record of tree mortality from replicated mapped permanent plots located in young ({\textless}60-year-old) and old-growth ({\textgreater}300-year-old) Abies amabilis forests. Trees in young forests died at a rate of 4.42{\%} per year, whereas trees in old-growth forests died at 0.60{\%} per year. Tree mortality in young forests was significantly aggregated, strongly density dependent, and caused live tree patterns to become more uniform through time. Mortality in old-growth forests was spatially aggregated, but was density independent and did not change the spatial pattern of surviving trees. These results extend current theory by demonstrating that densitydependent competitive mortality leading to increasingly uniform tree spacing in young forests ultimately transitions late in succession to a more diverse tree mortality regime that maintains spatial heterogeneity through time.},

abstract = {The role of future forests in global biogeochemical cycles will depend on how different tree species respond to climate. Interpreting the response of forest growth to climate change requires an understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of seasonal climatic influences on the growth of common tree species. We constructed a new network of 310 tree-ring width chronologies from three common tree species (Quercus robur, Pinus sylvestris and Fagus sylvatica) collected for different ecological, management and climate purposes in the south Baltic Sea region at the border of three bioclimatic zones (temperate continental, oceanic, southern boreal). The major climate factors (temperature, precipitation, drought) affecting tree growth at monthly and seasonal scales were identified. Our analysis documents that 20th century Scots pine and deciduous species growth is generally controlled by different climate parameters, and that summer moisture availability is increasingly important for the growth of deciduous species examined. We report changes in the influence of winter climate variables over the last decades, where a decreasing influence of late winter temperature on deciduous tree growth and an increasing influence of winter temperature on Scots pine growth was found. By comparing climate–growth responses for the 1943–1972 and 1973–2002 periods and characterizing site-level growth response stability, a descriptive application of spatial segregation analysis distinguished sites with stable responses to dominant climate parameters (northeast of the study region), and sites that collectively showed unstable responses to winter climate (southeast of the study region). The findings presented here highlight the temporally unstable and nonuniform responses of tree growth to climate variability, and that there are geographical coherent regions where these changes are similar. Considering continued climate change in the future, our results provide important regional perspectives on recent broad-scale climate–growth relationships for trees across the temperate to boreal forest transition around the south Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {Alpine treelines are considered monitors of the effects of climate on forest growth and dynamics. Treelines are expected to react to current climate warming by showing upslope migrations. However, treeline dynamics are often characterized by lagged responses to rising temperatures, that is, treeline inertia. In addition, encroachment within the treeline ecotone seems to be a more widespread response to climate warming than treeline ascent. We investigate how the treeline responds to climate in a Pyrenean site with an intense Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata) regeneration but also abundant dead trees. We use dendrochronology to reconstruct treeline dynamics (growth, tree recruitment, and death) and to build an age structure of Pyrenean Mountain pine forests, and relate them to temperature reconstructions of the study area. We also describe the spatial structure and estimate the size reproductive threshold of pine recruits. The study treeline showed profuse pine recruitment in the 1980s. These recruits were spatially aggregated and reached the 50{\%} probability of reproduction at 24 years old. Most Pyrenean Mountain pines were recruited in the first half of the 18th century, a warm period when growth was stable, while old treeline trees recruited not only in those decades but also in previous warm periods. Pine deaths concentrated in the cool transition between the mid 17th and the early 18th centuries and mainly from 1820 to 1860, when growth declined as a consequence of temperatures rapidly dropping at the end of the Little Ice Age. Only the amount of dead pines at the treeline was negatively related to temperatures, indicating that cool periods cause high adult mortality rates and trigger long-term treeline decline. But this decline was interrupted by intense regeneration and treeline encroachment, two features that characterize recent treeline dynamics in some mountains. This concurs with the view of a rapid response of alpine treelines to climate during the late 20th century.},

abstract = {Alpine treeline ecotones are considered early-warning monitors of the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, but it is still unclear how accurately treeline dynamics may track the expected temperature rises. Site-specific abiotic constraints, such as topography and demographic trends may make treelines less responsive to environmental fluctuations. A better understanding on how local processes modulate treelines' response to warming is thus required. We developed a model of treeline dynamics based on individual data of growth, mortality and reproduction. Specifically, we modeled growth patterns, mortality rates and reproductive size thresholds as a function of temperature and stand structure to evaluate the influence of climate- and stand-related processes on treeline dynamics. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of four Pyrenean mountain pine treeline sites with contrasting stand structures, and subjected to differing rates of climate warming. Our models indicate that Pyrenean treelines could reach basal areas and reproductive potentials similar to those currently observed in high-elevation subalpine forest by the mid twenty-first century. The fastest paces of treeline densification are forecasted by the late twenty-first century and are associated with higher warming rates. We found a common densification response of Pyrenean treelines to climate warming, but contrasting paces arise due to current size structures. Treelines characterized by a multistratified stand structure and subjected to lower mean annual temperatures were the most responsive to climate warming. In monostratified stands, tree growth was less sensitive to temperature than in multistratified stands and trees reached their reproductive size threshold later. Therefore, our simulations highlight that stand structure is paramount in modulating treeline responsiveness to ongoing climate warming. Synthesis. Treeline densification over the twenty-first century is likely to occur at different rates contingent on current stand structure and its effects on individual-level tree growth responses to warming. Accurate projections of future treeline dynamics must thus incorporate site-specific factors other than climate, specifically those related to stand structure and its influence on tree growth.},

abstract = {Effective adaptation of forest management practices to climate change will require a good understanding of the ecological and climatic factors influencing tree sensitivities and responses to climate. Using tree-ring data collected from 33 stands of mature interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) spanning a wide climatic range in British Columbia (BC), Canada, we present an approach combining high-resolution spatiotemporal climate data with traditional dendroecological analyses to quantify relationships between population climate-growth sensitivity and provenance (i.e., seed-source origin) climate. Key results showed that Douglas-fir climate-growth sensitivities were strongly linked to provenance climate and varied in coherent patterns across climatic gradients. Climate-growth sensitivities and responses were sometimes opposite between provenances from disparate climates. Perhaps most importantly, our results showed that Douglas-fir productivity across most of its range was sensitive to moisture limitations, and this sensitivity increased strongly with decreasing provenance mean annual precipitation and increasing heat-moisture index. Using geographic information systems, we visualize the link between provenance mean annual precipitation and climatic sensitivity of Douglas-fir across BC to identify "high risk" populations. By understanding the link between biological responses and climate, forest managers may be able to spatially identify sensitive populations using spatiotemporal climate data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We studied regional variation in growth-limiting factors and responses to climatic variability in subalpine forests by analyzing growth patterns for 28 tree-ring growth chronologies from subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) stands in the Cascade and Olympic Mountains (Washington and Oregon, U.S.A.). Factor analysis identified four distinct time series of common growth patterns; the dominant growth pattern at any site varied with annual precipitation and temperature (elevation). Throughout much of the region, growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation and spring snowpack depth, indicating that growth is limited primarily by short growing seasons. On the driest and warmest sites, growth is negatively correlated with previous summer temperature, suggesting that low summer soil moisture limits growth. Growth patterns in two regions were sensitive to climatic variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, apparently responding to low-frequency variation in spring snowpack and summer soil moisture (one negatively, one positively). This regional-scale analysis shows that subalpine fir growth in the Cascades and Olympics is limited by different climatic factors in different subregional climates. Climate-growth relationships are similar to those for a co-occurring species, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carri{\`{e}}re), suggesting broad biogeographic patterns of response to climatic variability and change by subalpine forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest.},

abstract = {The extension of growing season at high northern latitudes seems increasingly clear from satellite observations of vegetation extent and duration. This extension is also thought to explain the observed increase in amplitude of seasonal variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Increased plant respiration and photosynthesis both correlate well with increases in temperature this century and are therefore the most probable link between the vegetation and CO2 observations. From these observations, it has been suggested that increases in temperature have stimulated carbon uptake in high latitudes and for the boreal forest system as a whole. Here we present multi- proxy tree-ring data (ring width, maximum late-wood density and carbon- isotope composition) from 20 productive stands of white spruce in the interior of Alaska. The tree-ring records show a strong and consistent relationship over the past 90 years and indicate that, in contrast with earlier predictions, radial growth has decreased with increasing temperature. Our data show that temperature-induced drought stress has disproportionately affected the most rapidly growing white spruce, suggesting that, under recent climate warming, drought may have been an important factor limiting carbon uptake in a large portion of the North American boreal forest. If this limitation in growth due to drought stress is sustained, the future capacity of northern latitudes to sequester carbon may be less than currently expected. {\textcopyright} 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.},

We encourage flexible approaches that promote reversible and incremental steps, and that favor ongoing learning and capacity to modify direction as situations change. We suggest that no single solution fits all future challenges, especially in the context of changing climates, and that the best strategy is to mix different approaches for different situations. Resources managers will be challenged to integrate adaptation strategies (actions that help ecosystems accommodate changes adaptively) and mitigation strategies (actions that enable ecosystems to reduce anthropogenic influences on global climate) into overall plans. Adaptive strategies include resistance options (forestall impacts and protect highly valued resources), resilience options (improve the capacity of ecosystems to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response options (facilitate transition of ecosystems from current to new conditions). Mitigation strategies include options to sequester carbon and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. Priority-setting approaches (e.g., triage), appropriate for rapidly changing conditions and for situations where needs are greater than available capacity to respond, will become increasingly important in the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) recently experienced extensive crown thinning, branch dieback, and mortality across North America. To investigate the role of climate, we developed a range-wide bioclimate model that characterizes climatic factors controlling distribution of aspen. We also examined indices of moisture stress, insect defoliation and other factors as potential causes of the decline. Historic climate records show that most decline regions experienced exceptionally severe drought preceding the recent episodes. The bioclimate model, driven primarily by maximum summer temperatures and April-September precipitation, shows that decline tended to occur in marginally suitable habitat, and that climatic suitability decreased markedly in the period leading up to decline in almost all decline regions. Other factors, notably multi-year defoliation by tent caterpillars (Malacosoma spp.) and stem damage by fungi and insects, also play a substantial role in decline episodes, and may amplify or prolong the impacts of moisture stress on aspen over large areas. Many severely affected stands have poor regeneration potential, raising concerns that increasing aridity could ultimately lead to widespread loss of aspen forest cover. The analysis indicates that exceptional droughts were a major cause of the decline episodes, especially in the drier regions, and that aspen is sensitive to drought in much of its range. Coupling the bioclimate model with climate projections suggests that we should expect substantial loss of suitable habitat within the current distribution, especially in the USA and Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

They were based on increment cores, tree ring analyses and stump registrations. The presented models rely upon time series data from 1600 trees in thirty-one Norway spruce stands in south-eastern and central parts of Norway. The selective cuttings were heavy; on average two thirds of the standing volume were cut. The increment following the interventions was highly variable, resulting in large random variability in the models with R2 varying between 0.18-0.31 for individual tree diameter growth and 0.40-0.50 for mean tree stand diameter growth. Dummy variables referring to three first 5-year periods after cutting were found to increase the precision and significantly reduce the random error. Selected models were validated using a test material from central Norway and also compared with the mostly applied Norwegian diameter increment models. Despite a large random variation in all models, the model performances appeared logical and the general fit to the data was acceptable. Based on tests, two diameter increment models are recommended for future yield prognoses in MFS. The models should also be of interest for wider use in other parts of the Nordic and Baltic boreal zone.},

The aim of this research was to use climate and radial-growth data to explain how long-term climatic trends affect tree growth patterns along the southern limit of the range of Pinus nigra ssp. salzmannii (Eastern Baetic Range, southern Spain). We used regional temperature and precipitation data and measured sub-regional radial growth variation in P. nigra forests over the past two centuries. A dynamic factor analysis was applied to test the hypothesis that trees subjected to different climates have experienced contrasting long-term growth variability. We defined four representative stand types based on average temperature and precipitation to evaluate climate-growth relationships using linear mixed-effect models and multi-model selection criteria. All four stand types experienced warming and declining precipitation throughout the twentieth century. From the onset of the twentieth century, synchronised basal-area increment decline was accounted for by dynamic factor analysis and was related to drought by climate-growth models; declining basal-area increment trends proved stronger at lower elevations, whereas temperature was positively related to growth in areas with high rainfall inputs. Given the contrasting sub-regional tree-growth responses to climate change, the role of drought becomes even more complex in shaping communities and affecting selection pressure in the Mediterranean mountain forests. Potential vegetation shifts will likely occur over the dry edge of species distributions, with major impacts on ecosystem structure and function.},

abstract = {Significant increases in tree mortality due to drought-induced physiological stress have been documented worldwide. This trend is likely to continue with increased frequency and severity of extreme drought events in the future. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence variability in drought responses among trees will be critical to predicting ecosystem responses to climate change and developing effective management actions. In this study, we used hierarchical mixed-effects models to analyze drought responses of Pseudotsuga menziesii in 20 unmanaged forests stands across a broad range of environmental conditions in northeastern Washington, USA. We aimed to 1) identify the biotic and abiotic attributes most closely associated with the responses of individual trees to drought and 2) quantify the variability in drought responses at different spatial scales. We found that growth rates and competition for resources significantly affected resistance to a severe drought event in 2001: slow-growing trees and trees growing in subordinate canopy positions and/or with more neighbors suffered greater declines in radial growth during the drought event. In contrast, the ability of a tree to return to normal growth when climatic conditions improved (resilience) was unaffected by competition or relative growth rates. Drought responses were significantly influenced by tree age: older trees were more resistant but less resilient than younger trees. Finally, we found differences between resistance and resilience in spatial scale: a significant proportion (approximately 50{\%}) of the variability in drought resistance across the study area was at broad spatial scales (i.e. among different forest types), most likely due to differences in the total amount of precipitation received at different elevations; in contrast, variation in resilience was overwhelmingly (82{\%}) at the level of individual trees within stands and there was no difference in drought resilience among forest types. Our results suggest that for Pseudotsuga menziesii resistance and resilience to drought are driven by different factors and vary at different spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2017, Public Library of Science.

Partial cutting maintained stand structures similar to uncut old-growth stands, and the cutting had no significant effects on tree species composition.

Concerns about changing tree species composition, lack of spruce regeneration, and greatly reduced stand growth and vigor with partial cuts were largely unsubstantiated.

Such trends could affect the performance and growth of conifers in these drought-prone areas. We evaluated whether radial growth and wood density can act as proxy measures of precipitation and drought in a Mediterranean conifer. • Location. Iberian Juniperus thurifera forests in northern and eastern Spain. • Methods. We sampled 10 stands encompassing J. thurifera's distributional area. We related four annually resolved tree-ring variables (earlywood and latewood width, and maximum and minimum wood density) to climatic factors (temperature, precipitation and drought index) for the period 1951–2000. We then analysed the spatial and temporal patterns of those associations. • Results. Of all the four tree-ring variables analysed, minimum wood density presented the strongest response to climate. Higher values of minimum wood density were related to drier spring conditions, particularly in the most xeric sites, confirming that a drought-induced reduction in the radial expansion of tracheids increases earlywood density. • Main conclusions. Minimum wood density is a biogeographically meaningful proxy of spring water availability for the Mediterranean conifer J. thurifera. Minimum wood density of Juniperus thurifera is a robust proxy of spring water availability in a continental Mediterranean climate.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors regulating the composition and abundance of natural regeneration in forest ecosystems is critical to sustainable management worldwide. Using a long-term silvicultural experiment in Maine, we partitioned the variation in natural regeneration and examined the contribution of overstory and understory vegetation (biotic factors), substrate and soil attributes (abiotic factors), and silvicultural treatment. We hypothesized that silvicultural treatment (single-tree selection with 5, 10, and 20-year cutting cycles and diameter-limit cutting) would be less influential than abiotic and biotic factors in structuring regeneration pattern. Overall, treatment and site (biotic and abiotic) factors accounted for 26{\%} of the variation in regeneration species composition, highlighting stochasticity of the regeneration process. In support of our hypothesis, regeneration pattern that could be explained was primarily associated with local site factors; overstory and understory vegetation uniquely accounted for 16{\%} of the variation in species composition. Substrate and soil attributes along with silvicultural treatment accounted for 4{\%} of variation, and uniquely accounted for 2{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively. In support of earlier reports, shifts toward hardwood dominance were apparent at early stages of cohort development and were associated with high harvest intensities. Our findings suggested that overstory and understory vegetation exhibit greater control over regeneration patterns than substrate and soil attributes, or silvicultural treatment, in partially harvested Acadian Forest mixedwood stands, and also indicated the potential for composition control through selective overstory removal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This long-term experiment in Maine, U.S.A., was designed to provide information on the best silvicultural practices for managing stands of mixed northern conifers in northeastern U.S.A. We evaluated growth and yield and changes in species composition, quality, and structure during the first 40 years of the experiment. Replicated treatments include the selection system, uniform shelterwood, unregulated harvesting, and diameter-limit cutting. The new cohort established under three-stage shelterwood was subsequently left untreated or precommercially thinned. Between-treatment differences in net volume growth were not significant (?? = 0.10), though gross volume growth differed significantly for managed vs. unmanaged, selection vs. shelterwood, and shelterwood vs. diameter-limit treatments. A three-stage shelterwood method with precommercial thinning 10 years following final overstory removal resulted in good control of hardwoods and hemlock and a dramatic increase in spruce and fir. The selection system on a 5-year cutting cycle resulted in increased hemlock, spruce, and fir, with a decrease in hardwood species. If the primary goal were production, even-aged management would most likely be preferred. We recommend a two-stage shelterwood method as applied in this experiment with some modification to improve species composition and stand quality. Stand quality (proportion of stand volume in cull trees) and species composition was influenced by treatment.},

This often dramatic change, likely due to climate warming, has the potential to alter both the structure and function of tundra ecosystems.

However, dendrochronological methods developed for trees, need to be adapted for the morphology and growth eccentricity of shrubs. Here, we review current and developing methods to measure radial and axial growth, estimate age, and assess growth dynamics in relation to environmental variables. Recent advances in sampling methods, analysis and applications have improved our ability to investigate growth and recruitment dynamics of shrubs. However, to extrapolate findings to the biome scale, future dendroecological work will require improved approaches that better address variation in growth within parts of the plant, among individuals within populations and between species.},

@article{Buechling2017,
abstract = {Climate is widely assumed to influence physiological and demographic processes in trees, and hence forest composition, biomass and range limits. Growth in trees is an important barometer of climate change impacts on forests as growth is highly correlated with other demographic processes including tree mortality and fecundity. We investigated the main drivers of diameter growth for five common tree species occurring in the Rocky Mountains of the western United States using nonlinear regression methods. We quantified growth at the individual tree level from tree core samples collected across broad environmental gradients. We estimated the effects of both climate variation and biotic interactions on growth processes and tested for evidence that disjunct populations of a species respond differentially to climate. Relationships between tree growth and climate varied by species and location. Growth in all species responded positively to increases in annual moisture up to a threshold level. Modest linear responses to temperature, both positive and negative, were observed at many sites. However, model results also revealed evidence for differentiated responses to local site conditions in all species. In severe environments in particular, growth responses varied nonlinearly with temperature. For example, in northerly cold locations pronounced positive growth responses to increasing temperatures were observed. In warmer southerly climates, growth responses were unimodal, declining markedly above a threshold temperature level. Net effects from biotic interactions on diameter growth were negative for all study species. Evidence for facilitative effects was not detected. For some species, competitive effects more strongly influenced growth performance than climate. Competitive interactions also modified growth responses to climate to some degree. Synthesis. These analyses suggest that climate change will have complex, species-specific effects on tree growth in the Rocky Mountains due to nonlinear responses to climate, differentiated growth processes that vary by location and complex species interactions that impact growth and potentially modify responses to climate. Thus, robust model simulations of future growth responses to climate trends may need to integrate realistic scenarios of neighbourhood effects as well as variability in tree performance attributed to differentiated populations.},

abstract = {In this review I first compile data for the worldwide position of climate-driven alpine treelines. Causes for treeline formation are then discussed with a global perspective. Available evidence suggests a combination of a general thermal boundary for tree growth, with regionally variable 'modulatory' forces, including the presence of certain taxa. Much of the explanatory evidence found in the literature relates to these modulatory aspects at regional scales, whereas no good explanations emerged for the more fundamental global pattern related to temperature per se, on which this review is focused. I hypothesize that the life form 'tree' is limited at treeline altitudes by the potential investment, rather than production, of assimilates (growth as such, rather than photosynthesis or the carbon balance, being limited). In shoots coupled to a cold atmosphere, meristem activity is suggested to be limited for much of the time, especially at night. By reducing soil heat flux during the growing season the forest canopy negatively affects root zone temperature. The lower threshold temperature for tissue growth and development appears to be higher than 3°C and lower than 10°C, possibly in the 5.5-7.5°C range, most commonly associated with seasonal means of air temperature at treeline positions. The physiological and developmental mechanisms responsible have yet to be analyzed. Root zone temperature, though largely unknown, is likely to be most critical.},

An unharvested control (CON) was monitored for comparison. At the ecophysiological level, we mainly found differences in light-saturated photosynthesis of red spruce and specific leaf area of balsam fir among treatments. Consequently, we observed good height growth of both species in CON and INT, but fir surpassed spruce in SMA and LAR. Results suggest that intermediate 100-300 m2 irregular openings create microenvironmental conditions that may promote short-term ecophysiology and growth of red spruce, allowing the species to compete with balsam fir advance regeneration. Finally, results observed for spruce in large 700-m2 openings confirm its inability to grow as rapidly as fir in comparable open conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {In much of North America, variables such as temperature, precipitation, snowpack and streamflow are modulated by modes of large-scale ocean-atmosphere variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El Ni{\~{o}}-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific North American Pattern (PNA). In this study, we test the hypothesis that the influence of these modes on air temperature and precipitation in British Columbia (BC), Canada, can be explained in relation to changes in frequencies of synoptic-scale circulation types. A catalogue of 13 circulation types was derived by classifying daily mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) grids from 1948 to 2003. The grids cover BC and the North Pacific and were subjected to a standard pattern recognition algorithm employing principal component analysis followed by cluster analysis on the component scores. The circulation types are generally associated with distinctive patterns of precipitation and air temperature anomalies across BC. Multiple linear regressions for selected stations in BC using the type frequencies as predictors explain up to 75{\%} of the variance of mean winter temperature and 65{\%} of winter precipitation. The frequencies of most circulation types vary significantly between the different phases of ENSO, PDO and PNA in a manner consistent with the temperature anomalies associated with those modes and, to a lesser extent, with the more complex precipitation anomalies. In addition, however, average temperatures and precipitation amounts for some circulation types differ systematically between phases of ENSO and PDO. Subsequent analysis revealed distinct differences among ENSO and PDO phases in the upper-level circulation patterns associated with some surface types. A major part of the teleconnections can be explained through variations in the frequencies of synoptic-scale circulation types, but systematic within-type variability, particularly with PDO and PNA, can additionally influence the surface climate.

The procedure is based on previously defined monthly adjustments derived from step changes identified in annual Canadian temperature series. Daily temperatures are adjusted by incorporating a linear interpolation scheme that preserves these monthly adjustments. The temperature trends and variations present in the homogenized monthly and annual datasets are therefore preserved. Comparisons between unadjusted and adjusted daily temperatures at collocated sites show that the greatest impact of the adjustments is on the annual mean of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures with little effect on the standard deviation. The frequency and distribution of the extremes are much closer to those provided by the target observations after adjustments. Furthermore, the adjusted daily temperatures produced by this procedure greatly improve the spatial pattern of the observed twentieth century extreme temperature trends across the country.},

Here, we assess those contributions, along with harvesting effects, on biomass (both total and of individual species) in the southern boreal forest of Canada under three climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Projections were performed for three future 30-year time periods, in four study regions located on an east–west transect, using a forest landscape model (LANDIS-II), parameterized using a forest patch model (PICUS). Projected future impacts were assessed for each driver of change, and found to vary greatly among regions, species, future period and forcing scenarios. Fire, and stand-scale climate-induced impacts, had the strongest effects on forest vegetation, as well as on total and species' biomass under most RCP scenarios, but the largest impacts occurred mostly after 2050, particularly with the RCP 8.5 scenario. The relative importance and trends in species-specific impacts varied, both spatially and according to the different RCP scenarios. Western regions were generally more sensitive to stand-scale climate-induced changes, whereas eastern regions were more sensitive to changes in fire regime. Our study also highlights the importance of considering the prevalence of species-level functional traits when assessing the sensitivity of forest landscapes to a given driver of change in the context of increasing anthropogenic climate forcing. Synthesis. Increases in fire activity, and direct impacts of climate change on forest growth and regeneration, will be the most important drivers of future changes in southern boreal forest landscapes.},

abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is an important index of hydrologic budgets at different spatial scales and is a critical variable for understanding regional biological processes. It is often an important variable in estimating actual evapotranspiration (AET) in rainfall-runoff and ecosystem modeling. However, PET is defined in different ways in the literature and quantitative estimation of PET with existing mathematical formulas produces inconsistent results. The objectives of this study are to contrast six commonly used PET methods and quantify the long term annual PET across a physiographic gradient of 36 forested watersheds in the southeastern United States. Three temperature based (Thornthwaite, Hamon, and Hargreaves-Samani) and three radiation based (Turc, Makkink, and Priestley-Taylor) PET methods are compared. Long term water balances (precipitation, streamflow, and AET) for 36 forest dominated watersheds from 0.25 to 8213 km2 in size were estimated using associated hydrometeorological and land use databases. The study found that PET values calculated from the six methods were highly correlated (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.85 to 1.00). Multivariate statistical tests, however, showed that PET values from different methods were significantly different from each other. Greater differences were found among the temperature based PET methods than radiation based PET methods. In general, the Priestley-Taylor, Turc, and Hamon methods performed better than the other PET methods. Based on the criteria of availability of input data and correlations with AET values, the Priestley-Taylor, Turc, and Hamon methods are recommended for regional applications in the southeastern United States.},

abstract = {Using inventory data from a long-term silviculture experiment in east-central Maine, spatial models were developed to analyze 28 years (1974-2002) of stand structural dynamics. Differences in spatial pattern, species mingling, height differentiation, and relative stand complexity index (rSCI) were compared among five treatments: commercial clear-cutting, fixed diameter-limit, 5 year single-tree selection, three-stage shelterwood (both with and without precommercial thinning), and unharvested natural areas. Regardless of treatment, regeneration events (whether induced by natural breakup of the overstory or by harvesting) increased aggregation in spatial pattern and reduced species mingling, more so in the commercial clearcut and fixed diameter-limit treatments where hardwood densities were highest. Regular spatial patterns were rare. Height differentiation values for individual trees and stand-level mean rSCI were generally highest in untreated natural areas and 5 year selection treatments, intermediate in commercial clearcut and fixed diameter-limit treatments, and lowest in three-stage shelterwood treatments. After a brief adjustment period, precommercial thinning in a shelterwood treated stand generally increased species mingling, height differentiation, and rSCI. Two untreated natural areas exhibited divergent pathways of structural development. Dynamics in uneven-aged selection treatments more closely resembled that of the untreated natural areas than did the shelterwood, commercial clearcut, or fixed diameter limit treatments.

abstract = {Chronic, low intensity herbivory by invertebrates, termed background herbivory, has been understudied in tundra, yet its impacts are likely to increase in a warmer Arctic. The magnitude of these changes is however hard to predict as we know little about the drivers of current levels of invertebrate herbivory in tundra. We assessed the intensity of invertebrate herbivory on a common tundra plant, the dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa-nana complex), and investigated its relationship to latitude and climate across the tundra biome. Leaf damage by defoliating, mining and gall-forming invertebrates was measured in samples collected from 192 sites at 56 locations. Our results indicate that invertebrate herbivory is nearly ubiquitous across the tundra biome but occurs at low intensity. On average, invertebrates damaged 11.2{\%} of the leaves and removed 1.4{\%} of total leaf area. The damage was mainly caused by external leaf feeders, and most damaged leaves were only slightly affected (12{\%} leaf area lost). Foliar damage was consistently positively correlated with mid-summer (July) temperature and, to a lesser extent, precipitation in the year of data collection, irrespective of latitude. Our models predict that, on average, foliar losses to invertebrates on dwarf birch are likely to increase by 6–7{\%} over the current levels with a 1 °C increase in summer temperatures. Our results show that invertebrate herbivory on dwarf birch is small in magnitude but given its prevalence and dependence on climatic variables, background invertebrate herbivory should be included in predictions of climate change impacts on tundra ecosystems.},

Mill.] crop trees were assessed 25 years after treatment in an even-aged northern conifer stand. Treatments were a uniform 2.4 × 2.4-m spacing and a control (no PCT). The PCT treatment significantly increased individual tree diameter at breast height (DBH), height growth, crown ratio, and crown width, while it reduced the tree height to DBH ratio. PCT also significantly increased stem taper and consequently, regional volume equations overpredicted observed stem volume by 2 to 15{\%}, particularly for the spaced trees. PCT also increased the number and maximum size of branches on the lower bole. The sizes of knots on half of the sampled spruce crop trees in the spaced plots precluded them from being used as select structural lumber; there were no other effects on log grade. Our findings indicate that PCT can have a long-term influence on the structural attributes of individual trees, and that improved stem-volume prediction equations are needed in the Acadian region of North America.},

abstract = {1 We developed a spatially explicit and individual-based simulation model describing the dynamics of tree populations across treeline ecotones. Our aims were to identify minimal factors and processes able to generate treeline types with abrupt vs. smooth transitions in different variables (tree height, age, density), to investigate the role of positive feedback in pattern generation, and to determine why krummholz appears at some but not all treelines. We hypothesized that a different balance between smooth growth and mortality gradients across the treeline ecotone could account for differences between commonly observed treeline types. 2 The model contained only processes and factors regarded as essential for producing a treeline ecotone and was parameterized with an extensive, individual-based data set from Pinus uncinata treelines in the Spanish Pyrenees. However, parameters expected to influence treeline type were systematically varied. 3 The simple model was able to generate major treeline types differing in abruptness and krummholz abundance. The most important factors determining treeline types were the relative strength of growth and mortality gradients, followed by facilitation strength, whereas demographic parameters accounted for more subtle differences. 4 Only certain combinations of growth inhibition, mortality and facilitation allowed for the emergence of certain treeline types characterized by contrasting abruptness values and the presence or absence of krummholz. High krummholz densities emerged only under positive feedback and strongly increasing growth inhibition across the ecotone. Abruptness in adult tree density was positively correlated with facilitation strength and growth inhibition. By contrast, treelines with abrupt height transitions occurred only where both low growth inhibition and a strongly increasing mortality occurred across the ecotone. 5 Our analysis suggests that treeline features are not arbitrary but that there is a clear signal in the pattern which allows for inference of the underlying processes. Our approach of a systematic comparison of model predictions and various observed patterns can be widely applied for testing hypotheses on the functioning of ecological systems and for deriving specific questions for further investigations in the field.},

abstract = {Understanding the response of tree regeneration following commercial thinning treatments can improve planning in managed forests dependent on natural regeneration. We used long-term commercial thinning experiments in eastern spruce-fir stands of Maine, USA, to test two hypotheses: (1) commercial thinning increases the density of tree regeneration and (2) tree regeneration density increases with increasing thinning intensity. A decade after thinning, densities of softwood and hardwood regeneration were 10 times greater in thinned stands than unthinned stands. The abundance of small softwood (0.11-0.60mtall) was highest in lower intensity thinning treatments, whereas medium (0.61-1.40mtall) and large (≥1.41mtall to 8.90 cm diameter at breast height) softwoods increased proportionally with thinning intensity, a pattern related to a higher rate of recruitment in more open stands created by heavier thinning. Hardwood density generally increased with thinning intensity and developed into a significant component of the large size class. Softwood regeneration density was higher in older spruce stands than younger fir stands, which may be due to greater abundance of advance regeneration, higher residual stand mortality, and greater harvest disturbance in older spruce stands. However, acceptable softwood stocking was achieved in all replicates of thinning treatments. Therefore, in addition to providing higher individual-tree growth and merchantable yield, commercial thinning in eastern spruce-fir stands also increases regeneration density. The rate of recruitment also increased as thinning intensity increased, thus stimulating understory regeneration similar to that of a shelterwood establishment cut.},

abstract = {A white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) overstory of a 30+ year old stand was thinned or completely removed , releasing an advance regeneration of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.). The overstory was clear-cut (T0), thinned to 600 (T600) or to 1200 (T1200) stems/ha, or left uncut (control). Three years after release, understory responses were best demonstrated by decreasing specific leaf area with increasing release level and by changes to height and radial growth increments. Clear-cutting the overstory stalled the height growth in fir for two seasons and radial growth at the tree base for one season. Compared with the control, the 3-year height increment was proportionally greatest in intermediate trees of T600, and this treatment produced the overall best response in height growth. Complete birch removal produced the best radial growth response despite the initial growth check. However, no release treatment significantly affected the whole tree variables (aboveground biomass, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), live crown ratio) within the studied time frame.

Seedling growth was best in large openings and similar in opening sizes from 1 ha to 0.1 ha. Smaller openings created by group selection and individual tree selection methods were not favourable for successful planting at elevations close to timberline. The two species had similar absolute and relative growth rates but spruce responded more strongly to better growing environments.},

abstract = {The forest water balance model presented requires only daily solar radiation, maximum and minimum air temperature, and rainfall as the input weather data. Site parameters are root zone depth, soil water retention and drainage characteristics, estimated canopy leaf area index, and the coefficients of the evapotranspiration and rainfall interception submodels. The evapotranspiration submodel calculates the forest evapotranspiration rate as the lesser of energy‐limited and soil‐limited rates. The former is calculated from the 24‐hour net radiation and the latter from the fraction of extractable water in the root zone. Solar radiation and air temperature are used to calculate net radiation. Interception is calculated from the daily rainfall. The root zone is treated as a single layer with drainage calculated as a function of the root zone water content. Water deficits and the matric potential of the root zone are used to indicate tree Water stress. The model was tested on two Douglas fir stands of different stand density and leaf area index. The coefficients used in the evapotranspiration submodel were found to be the same for both stands. It was also found that over 20{\%} of the growing season rainfall was lost through interception.

Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52{\%} of sites with only 1{\%} reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review: Despite the rapidly increasing use of resilience indices to analyze responses of trees and forests to disturbance events, there is so far no common framework to apply and interpret these indices for different purposes. Therefore, this review aims to identify and discuss various shortcomings and pitfalls of commonly used resilience indices and to develop recommendations for a more robust and standardized procedure with a particular emphasis on drought events. Recent Findings: Growth-based resilience indices for drought responses of trees are widely used but some important drawbacks and limitations related to their application may lead to spurious results or misinterpretation of observed patterns. The limitations include (a) the inconsistency regarding the selection and characterization of drought events and the climatic conditions in the pre- and post-drought period and (b) the calculation procedure of growth-based resilience indices. Summary: We discuss alternative options for metrics, which, when used in concert, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of drought responses in cases where common growth-based resilience indices are likely to fail. In addition, we propose a new analytical framework, the “line of full resilience,” that integrates the three most commonly used resilience indices and show how this framework can be used for comparative drought tolerance assessments such as rankings of different tree species or treatments. The suggested approach could be used to harmonize quantifications of tree growth resilience to drought and it may thus facilitate systematic reviews and development of the urgently needed evidence base to identify suitable management options or tree species and provenances to adapt forests for changing climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Land managers face increasing challenges as they try to balance timber harvesting with the habitat require- ments of wildlife, including those of woodland caribou in north-central British Columbia. With the aim of conserving caribou by improving forest practices, we employed a hierarchical, scale-explicit approach to study the processes governing movement and distribution of the northern woodland caribou ecotype. Investigations of foraging sites north of Prince George, British Columbia revealed that caribou in forested and alpine areas cratered at locations with relatively low snow depths and relatively large amounts of terrestrial lichens. When snow depth, snow hardness, and snow density increased, caribou fed more frequently at trees supporting abundant arboreal lichens. Feeding activities of caribou in forested foraging patches were positively related to the biomass of several terrestrial lichen species and to decreasing snow depth; the number of arboreal feeding sites increased as snow depth and hardness increased. We identified three scales of habitat selection based on movement rates of caribou fitted with GPS collars. For all scales, caribou selected pine-lichen woodland and windswept rocky slopes. Predation risk was greatest for cari- bou travelling between habitat patches, was lowest for caribou in alpine habitats, and had no apparent influence on intra-patch movements. Land use plans should address the needs of northern woodland caribou by ensuring that large patches of widely distributed pine-lichen woodland are maintained on the landscape, recognize the limiting effects of deep snow (i.e., {\textgreater} 50–80 cm), and encourage silvicultural strategies that minimize the creation of early seral-stage forests adjacent to caribou movement routes.},

Core samples were taken from selected stands with very differing site conditions at three altitudes, and tree-ring parameters including maximum latewood density, late-wood width, and total width were measured. A special type of diagram was developed to assist analysis of the complex relationships between tree-ring growth, weather, and site conditions on a year-for-year basis. This is a departure from the conventional approach of analyzing only mean relationships over long time sequences. An advantage of the elaborated single-year method is that the growth models are allowed to vary with time. Typical cases are illustrated , and the dynamics of the overlapping influences of weather and site conditions are discussed. The second procedure comprises the visual identification and dating of abrupt, persistent changes in the tree-ring pattern and their relation to biotic and abiotic factors. This allows the reconstruction of insect attacks, forest fires, and forest clearing.},

abstract = {The general trend of climatically-driven treeline advance is modified by regional, local and temporal variations. Treelines will not advance in a closed front parallel to the shift of any isotherm to higher elevations and more northern latitudes. The effects of varying topography on site conditions and the after-effects of historical disturbances by natural and anthropogenic factors may override the effects of slightly higher average temperatures. Moreover, the varying treeline-forming species respond in different ways to a changing climate. Forest advance upwards and northwards primarily depends on successful regeneration and survival of young growth rather than on increasing growth rates of mature trees. Every assessment of treeline response to future climate change must consider the effects of local site conditions and feedbacks of increasing tree population in modulating the climatically-driven change. Treeline-shift will influence regional and local climates, pedogenesis, plant communities, animal populations and biodiversity as well as having a considerable effect on economic changes in primary production. A better understanding of the functional relationships between the many treeline-relevant factors and treeline dynamics can be achieved only by extensive research at different scales within different climatic regions supported by as many as possible experimental studies in the field together with laboratory and remote sensing techniques.},

abstract = {Increasingly, forest management goals include building or maintaining resistance and/or resilience to disturbances in the face of climate change. Although a multitude of descriptive definitions for resistance and resilience exist, to evaluate whether specific management activities (silviculture) are effective, prescriptive characterizations are necessary. We introduce a conceptual framework that explicitly differentiates resistance and resilience, denotes appropriate scales, and establishes the context for evaluation—structure and composition. Generally, resistance is characterized as the influence of structure and composition on disturbance, whereas resilience is characterized as the influence of disturbance on subsequent structure and composition. Silvicultural utility of the framework is demonstrated by describing disturbance-specific, time-bound structural and compositional objectives for building resistance and resilience to two fundamentally different disturbances: wildfires and spruce beetle outbreaks. The conceptual framework revealed the crucial insight that attempts to build stand or landscape resistance to spruce beetle outbreaks will ultimately be unsuccessful. This frees the silviculturist to focus on realistic goals associated with building resilience to likely inevitable outbreaks. Ultimately, because structure and composition, at appropriate scales, are presented as the standards for evaluation and manipulation, the framework is broadly applicable to many kinds of disturbance in various forest types.},

The following factors combined in a multiple linear regression model were found to predict seed production (based on withheld data points) with considerable accuracy, at high levels of statistical significance: June-July mean temperature and August lowest temperature in the previous year, late spring frost and June-July precipitation of the last 2 years, and January-February lowest temperature in the current year. Tree ring width was negatively correlated with the seed production index of the current year and the lowest July temperature in the previous year and positively correlated with June-July precipitation in the current year. It is suggested that habitat constraints for seedling establishment should also be considered in a more general life-history cost theory to explain masting behaviour in forest trees.},

abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration models very often are important part of hydrological catchment models to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PET) which then is used to estimate actual evapotranspiration considering the soil moisture status. As many different approaches exist, the question arises in which way the choice of the PET model affects the impact of climate change on the calculated water balance? Therefore, 18 different PET models were compared with respect to their sensitivity to observed climate change. Long-term climate data of six German climate stations were used to identify changes in the climate data itself and changes in the calculated PET. The results show that all investigated PET models are sensitive to significant trends in climate data. However, it is also shown that all models show different sensitivities, and that the sensitivities cannot be grouped in terms of different types of PET models such as the aerodynamic concept, radiation or temperature based approaches and combination equations. Predominantly, the variability within a group of models of the same type is comparable to the variability between different model types. Therefore it can be concluded that PET models should be validated in a regional context before they are applied to a certain region within a climate change study despite the poor availability of long-term PET measurements. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Partial cuts significantly increased stomatal conduc-tance of red spruce only. Light-saturated photosynthesis (leaf-area basis) of both species increased with BA removal, but unlike red spruce, specific leaf area (SLA) of balsam fir decreased with increased cutting intensity. Partial cuts appreciably increased the concentration of N and Ca in red spruce and balsam fir foliage, respectively, and resulted in decreased foliar concentrations of K in red spruce and Mg in balsam fir. The height and lateral growth of both species increased with BA removal, although partial cuts were more beneficial to balsam fir. The data suggest that short advance regeneration of red spruce and balsam fir can coexist under partial overstory conditions, but balsam fir has physiological characteristics and a capacity for morphological adjustment (SLA) that places it at an advantage when in competition with red spruce.},

abstract = {A wealth of recent research has improved our understanding of the structure, growth and yield of mixed-species stands. However, appropriate quantitative concepts for their silvicultural regulation remain scarce. Due to the species-specific stand densities, growing area requirements and potential over-density, the density and mixing regulation in mixed stands is much more intricate than in monospecific stands. Here, we introduce the species-specific coefficients: density equivalence coefficients (DEC), for density equivalence; and density modification coefficient (DMC), for density modification in mixed species stands. DEC is suitable for the conversion of the stand density and growing area requirement of one species into that of another species. DMC estimates the modification of maximum stand density by tree species mixing using as reference the maximum stand density of one of the species. First, we introduce the theoretical concept of these coefficients. Second, we derive the mean values of these coefficients based on long-Term experiments using different mixtures of European beech. Third, we apply DEC and DMC for flexible regulation of the stand density and mixing proportion. Thus, silvicultural regulation of monospecific stands and mixed-species stands forms a continuum, where monospecific stands represent an extreme case of mixed-species stands. Lastly, we discuss the advantages and limitations of these concepts. Future directions comprise the inclusion of additional species, their integration in guidelines and simulation models, and their establishment for the quantitative regulation of experimental plots and the practical implementation in forest stands.},

@article{Korner1998,
abstract = {In this review I first compile data for the worldwide position of climate-driven alpine treelines. Causes for treeline formation are then discussed with a global perspective. Available evidence suggests a combination of a general thermal boundary for tree growth, with regionally variable "modulatory" forces, including the presence of certain taxa. Much of the explanatory evidence found in the literature relates to these modulatory aspects at regional scales, whereas no good explanations emerged for the more fundamental global pattern related to temperature per se, on which this review is focused. I hypothesize that the life form "tree" is limited at treeline altitudes by the potential investment, rather than production, of assimilates (growth as such, rather than photosynthesis or the carbon balance, being limited). In shoots coupled to a cold atmosphere, meristem activity is suggested to be limited for much of the time, especially at night. By reducing soil heat flux during the growing season the forest canopy negatively affects root zone temperature. The lower threshold temperature for tissue growth and development appears to be higher than 3 degrees C and lower than 10 degrees C, possibly in the 5.5-7.5 degrees C range, most commonly associated with seasonal means of air temperature at treeline positions. The physiological and developmental mechanisms responsible have yet to be analyzed. Root zone temperature, though largely unknown, is likely to be most critical.},

abstract = { The ratio between projected leaf area (LA) and cross-sectional sapwood area (SA) of dominant and codominant balsam fir trees (Abiesbalsamea (L.) Mill.) was determined in 24 forest stands across the province of Quebec. Various physical factors proposed in the Whitehead hydraulic model, and some of the easily measured surrogates of these factors, were tested for their influence on LA:SA ratios. Average growing season vapor pressure deficit, temperature, precipitation, and stand drainage class did not significantly influence LA:SA ratios. On the other hand, LA:SA ratios were positively influenced by sapwood permeability (k), tree height, and crown length. As suggested by the model, there was a positive correlation between sapwood permeability and LA:SA ratio and a negative correlation between tree height or crown length and LA/(SA k). Increases in sapwood permeability with tree age were associated with longer tracheids having larger lumen diameters. Of the various empirical factors tested, only site quality, 5-year basal area growth, and age had a significant influence on LA:SA ratios. Sapwood cross-sectional area at breast height by itself was a reasonable linear predictor of LA for all stands (LA = −0.158 + 0.709 SA BH , R 2 = 0.75). Using the variables that were previously determined to influence LA:SA ratios, stepwise regressions revealed that only crown length and 5-year basal area growth significantly improved linear predictions of LA based on sapwood area. However, the increase in R 2 was relatively modest, i.e., 0.83 for all three independent variables versus 0.75 for SA alone. The results from this study will be useful in integrating physiologically based measurements, such as growth efficiency, into standard forest inventory practices for balsam fir and thus could be beneficial in developing new silvicultural strategies for protecting Quebec's forest resource. },

abstract = {This work addresses the driving factors responsible for patterns in the detritivore macrofaunal communities of a managed beechwood chronosequence (28 to 197 years old, Normandy, France). We investigated the variation patterns of density, biomass and diversities of detritivore macrofauna throughout this rotation. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify the main covariation patterns between species and some properties of their physical environment, and to describe the main ecological gradients constraining the macro-invertebrate community assembly. A total of 6 earthworm, 6 woodlouse and 7 millipede species were found in the whole data set. Density, biomass and diversity were profoundly influenced by forest ageing, mainly because of variation in humic epipedon spatial variability. Three groups of species were identified according to their environmental requirements. Some hypotheses regarding the external (related to management practices) or internal (related to inter-specific interactions) assembly rules behind species assemblages are proposed, an approach which has rarely been used in soil ecology. Finally, the impact of forestry practices on soil functioning through their impact on detritivore macro-invertebrate communities is discussed.},

The earlywood, latewood, and total ring width, and latewood and maximum density decreased significantly with increasing elevation. Since no significant trend was observed for latewood percentage and ring density, decline in maximum density will have minor impacts on wood quality of high and low-elevation Abies lasiocarpa. The correlation and response functions indicated that response to climatic factors changed with elevation. Although mesic sites within the study area were not expected to be water deficient, ring width decreased with the occurrence of warm and dry spring weather in low-elevation. Low summer temperature limited ring width in high-elevation and maximum latewood density and latewood width in low- and high-elevation, albeit the relationship was much stronger in high- elevation.},

Partial cuts significantly increased stomatal conductance of red spruce only. Light-saturated photosynthesis (leaf-area basis) of both species increased with BA removal, but unlike red spruce, specific leaf area (SLA) of balsam fir decreased with increased cutting intensity. Partial cuts appreciably increased the concentration of N and Ca in red spruce and balsam fir foliage, respectively, and resulted in decreased foliar concentrations of K in red spruce and Mg in balsam fir. The height and lateral growth of both species increased with BA removal, although partial cuts were more beneficial to balsam fir. The data suggest that short advance regeneration of red spruce and balsam fir can coexist under partial overstory conditions, but balsam fir has physiological characteristics and a capacity for morphological adjustment (SLA) that places it at an advantage when in competition with red spruce. {\textcopyright} 2008 Heron Publishing.},

abstract = {Stand structure can strongly influence forest growth and other processes, such as the water balance, carbon partitioning, nutrient cycling and light dynamics. However, individual structural variables can be positively or negatively correlated with growth. This is the case for variables such as size inequality and those that describe resource partitioning, such as the degree of symmetric/asymmetric competition and growth dominance. Several contrasting growth-structure correlations are reviewed and linked to forest processes by considering the different types of tree interactions they are associated with. Contrasting growth-structure correlations appear to converge when they are examined using a simple framework where stand growth is a function of three variables as opposed to any one of the variables alone; stand density, size distributions and tree size-growth relationships. The size distributions quantify how the stand density is distributed between the different sizes while the size-growth relationships quantify how growth is partitioned between different sizes. Size inequality may not often be a useful explanatory variable and instead it appears to sometimes correlate with growth because it can be correlated with other variables that influence growth. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the effects of structure on growth have received little attention and a long-term growth and yield data set from central Europe was used to examine how the effects of structure can change along climatic gradients. The simple framework of three variables could be used to separate the effects of structure and functioning when comparing mixed and monospecific forests, as well as to design silvicultural interventions or to determine whether past management interventions have achieved their goals. The implications for selecting which structural variables to use and when scaling up to the stand level, are also discussed.},

Juvenile wood density for individual test sites ranged from 0.378 to 0.481. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis with wood density as the dependent variable and a battery of annual and monthly climate variables as independent variables was used to model the current distribution of wood density across the landscape in coastal British Columbia. Differences in the average temperature between the coldest month and the warmest month, precipitation in July, and the mean annual precipitation were the only significant variables predicting wood density, accounting for 47{\%} of the total variation across all sites. Using two future climate change models (CGCM2 A2x and HADCM3 A2x) to predict changes in the three climate variables, wood density was mapped. Wood density will be reduced generally in the present range of coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii), especially on southern Vancouver Island and along the coastlines of southern British Columbia. This may have implications for the future utility of Douglas-fir as a structural wood species, as well as for breeding and deployment.},

Previous studies revealed inconsistent findings on the elevational dependence of warming in the mountains. In this study, the trends and elevational dependence of air temperature in the Cariboo Mountains Region (CMR) of British Columbia are explored using a surface air temperature dataset with a spatial resolution of five arc minutes over the 1950-2010 period. A Mann-Kendall test is performed for evaluation of trends and their significance. In recent decades the CMR has been warming at a faster rate than regional and global warming. The minimum air temperature trend shows significant amplified warming at higher elevations. The snow-albedo feedback and changes in cloud cover over the CMR may possibly be the major physical mechanisms responsible for these trends. The implications of such changes on the endangered mountain caribou and water resources of the area are also discussed.},

abstract = {We used dendroclimatology to quantify inter-annual to multi-decadal climatic variation effects on white spruce radial growth in southwest Yukon, Canada. Local climate is dry and cold, such that tree growth was primarily moisture- rather than temperature-limited, although the mechanisms varied temporally. During the 20th century, significant increases in precipitation countered warming temperatures, so that heat-moisture indices have not changed significantly. Directional climatic change, superimposed on variation due to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), resulted in unstable climate-growth relations. Prior to 1977, ring widths were positively correlated with previous growing season precipitation and warm temperatures had a negative impact, exacerbating moisture limitations in dry years especially during the cool, dry negative PDO phase (1946-1976). After 1977, correlations with previous growing season precipitation became negative and correlations with previous fall and winter precipitation and current year July and August temperatures became positive, although not statistically significant. These changes suggest precipitation and temperature increases over recent decades benefitted white spruce growth. Climate projections for this region include further temperature and precipitation increases, which may promote white spruce growth depending on the seasonality and interactions between temperature and precipitation. This study demonstrated the complexity of potential responses of white spruce to climate variation and change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The ultimate reason for their decline is habitat alterations by industrial activities. The proximate causes are predation and, to a lesser extent, overharvest.

Mountain caribou are threatened by similar industrial activities as Boreal caribou, and face increasing harassment from motorized winter recreational activities.

We evaluate the magnitude of this potential bias using a spatially unbiased tree-ring network collected by the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. We show that U.S. Southwest ITRDB samples overestimate regional forest climate sensitivity by 41–59{\%}, because ITRDB trees were sampled at warmer and drier locations, both at the macro- and micro-site scale, and are systematically older compared to the FIA collection. Although there are uncertainties associated with our statistical approach, projection based on representative FIA samples suggests 29{\%} less of a climate change-induced growth decrease compared to projection based on climate-sensitive ITRDB samples.},

abstract = {A new method for studying stand disturbance regimes, which could be used alone or combined with other approaches (e.g., age class analysis, tree ring analysis, direct gap measurements), is presented. The method is a set of multiple regression models that estimate the year of death of trees on the basis of external characteristics (e.g., bark presence) and tree position (standing or down). The models were calibrated for Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x P. engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. trees with known dates of death determined from permanent sample plot data obtained from the Aleza Lake Research Forest, in east-central British Columbia, in the wet cool foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The P. glauca x P. engelmannii model explained 95.3{\%} and 79.3{\%}, and the A. lasiocarpa model explained 81.2{\%} and 78.2{\%}, of the variation in years since death for standing and down trees, respectively. The models were validated by an independent sample of dead trees, where the model estimate was compared with year of release determined from tree ring cores in subordinate understory trees. The two estimates were related (R2 = 61.3{\%}, for both species), indicating that the model provides acceptable estimates for year of death in the two species. This approach may be particularly useful for determining year of death for trees that do not have subordinate individuals that release following overstory mortality.},

abstract = {1. We explored whether the independent evolutionary history of extratropical forests in the southern and northern hemispheres affects the temperature-elevation relationship of mountain forest lines. We compiled 115 forest line descriptions from the literature, covering the major extratropical mountain ranges of the world. We related forest line elevation to thermal regimes using mean annual temperature adjusted to sea level (MAT) and seasonal thermal amplitude (STA, mean of the warmest month minus the mean of the coldest) obtained from a global climate database. 2. Thermal variables explained 79{\%} of the global variability of forest line elevation, which increased approximately 130 m for every 1 K of MAT and for every 2 K of STA. After considering STA, there was no significant effect of 'hemi-sphere' on forest line elevation. MAT-elevation relationships for sites with STA {\textless} 15 K were the same between hemispheres. 3. Sites dominated by different tree life forms had similar mean temperatures for the warmest month (differences {\textless} 3 K), but contrasting mean temperatures for the coldest (differences {\textgreater} 30 K). Along a gradient of increasing STA and decreasing winter temperatures, forest lines were first dominated by evergreen broadleaf trees, followed by deciduous broadleaf species, evergreen conifers, and finally deciduous conifers. 4. Our results suggest that temperatures during the warm part of the year are the main control of forest line elevation in extratropical regions while temperatures during the cold part of the year affect the dominant life form of trees. There is a high degree of convergence in adaptation to mountain climates between trees species of both hemispheres. This convergence suggests that there is not a wide vacant altitudinal belt for introduced forest line species of the northern hemisphere into the southern hemisphere.},

Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) were aggregated in order to unify the somewhat scattered sources of information currently available, as well as to develop a sound working hypothesis about mixing effects. The database contains information from 23 long-term plots, covering an ecological gradient from nutrient poor and dry to nutrient rich and moist sites throughout Central Europe. • An empirically formed interaction model showed, that depending on the site conditions, dry mass growth in mixed stands can range from - 46{\%} to +138 {\%} of the growth yielded by a scaled combination of pure stands at equal mixing proportions. • Drawing from the interaction model, overyielding of the mixed stands appears to be triggered by two separate mechanisms. On poor sites, where significant overyielding is commonly found, facilitation by beech offsets nutrient-related growth limitations in spruce. In contrast, overyielding of mixed stands occurs less frequently on rich sites, and appears to be based on an admixture effect, with spruce reducing the severe intra-specific competition common in pure beech stands. • It was concluded that silviculture can accelerate growth of spruce by beech admixtures on poor sites, while growth of beech can be promoted by admixture of spruce, particularly on excellent sites. {\textcopyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2010.},

abstract = {This paper integrates dendrochronological, demographic, and experimental perspectives to improve understanding of the response of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) tree growth to climatic variability in interior Alaska. The dendrochronological analyses indicate that climate warming has led to widespread declines in white spruce growth throughout interior Alaska that have become more prevalent during the 20th century. Similarly, demographic studies show that white spruce tree growth is substantially limited by soil moisture availability in both mid- and late-successional stands. Interannual variability in tree growth among stands within a landscape exhibits greater synchrony than does growth of trees that occupy different landscapes, which agrees with dendrochronological findings that the responses depend on landscape position and prevailing climate. In contrast, the results from 18 years of a summer moisture limitation experiment showed that growth in midsuccessional upland stands was unaffected by moisture limitation and that moisture limitation decreased white spruce growth in floodplain stands where it was expected that growth would be less vulnerable because of tree access to river water. Taken together, the evidence from the different perspectives analyzed in this study clearly indicates that white spruce tree growth in interior Alaska is vulnerable to the effects of warming on plant water balance.},

A modification of the Blaney and Criddle method, in which the c parameter is calculated from seasonal regression equations with the mean monthly temperature as the independent variable, is proposed and tested. It is found to work sufficiently well in the area of interest, the Mediterranean Basin. For a network of 248 Mediterranean temperature stations, present‐day seasonal mean potential evapotranspiration is estimated by this method. Using the results from four equilibrium‐mode general circulation models, seasonal mean scenarios of potential evapotranspiration per 1°C rise in global mean temperature caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect are presented. Comparison of scenarios of the change in potential evapotranspiration and scenarios of the change in precipitation indicates an unfavourable shift in moisture availability due to the enhanced greenhouse effect, throughout the Mediterranean region.

@article{Korner2004,
abstract = {Aim: At a coarse scale, the treelines of the world's mountains seem to follow a common isotherm, but the evidence for this has been indirect so far. Here we aim at underpinning this with facts. Location: We present the results of a data-logging campaign at 46 treeline sites between 68° N and 42° S. Methods: We measured root-zone temperatures with an hourly resolution over 1-3 years per site between 1996 and 2003. Results: Disregarding taxon-, landuse- or fire-driven tree limits, high altitude climatic treelines are associated with a seasonal mean ground temperature of 6.7°C (±0.8 SD; 2.2 K amplitude of means for different climatic zones), a surprisingly narrow range. Temperatures are higher (7-8°C) in the temperate and Mediterranean zone treelines, and are lower in equatorial treelines (5-6°C) and in the subarctic and boreal zone (6-7°C). While air temperatures are higher than soil temperatures in warm periods, and are lower than soil temperatures in cold periods, daily means of air and soil temperature are almost the same at 6-7°C, a physics driven coincidence with the global mean temperature at treeline. The length of the growing season, thermal extremes or thermal sums have no predictive value for treeline altitude on a global scale. Some Mediterranean (Fagus spp.) and temperate South Hemisphere treelines (Nothofagus spp.) and the native treeline in Hawaii (Metrosideros) are located at substantially higher isotherms and represent genus-specific boundaries rather than boundaries of the life-form tree. In seasonal climates, ground temperatures in winter (absolute minima) reflect local snow pack and seem uncritical. Main conclusions: The data support the hypothesis of a common thermal threshold for forest growth at high elevation, but also reflect a moderate region and substantial taxonomic influence.},

abstract = {Climate change is challenging forestry management and practices. Among other things, tree species with the ability to cope with more extreme climate conditions have to be identified. However, while environmental factors may severely limit tree growth or even cause tree death, assessing a tree species' potential for surviving future aggravated environmental conditions is rather demanding. The aim of this study was to find a tree-ring-based method suitable for identifying very droughttolerant species, particularly potential substitute species for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Valais. In this inner-Alpine valley, Scots pine used to be the dominating species for dry forests, but today it suffers from high drought-induced mortality. We investigate the growth response of two native tree species, Scots pine and European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), and two non-native species, black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. var. menziesii), to drought. This involved analysing how the radial increment of these species responded to increasing water shortage (abandonment of irrigation) and to increasingly frequent drought years. Black pine and Douglas fir are able to cope with drought better than Scots pine and larch, as they show relatively high radial growth even after irrigation has been stopped and a plastic growth response to drought years. European larch does not seem to be able to cope with these dry conditions as it lacks the ability to recover from drought years. The analysis of trees' short-term response to extreme climate events seems to be the most promising and suitable method for detecting how tolerant a tree species is towards drought. However, combining all the methods used in this study provides a complete picture of how water shortage could limit species. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.},

Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52{\%} of sites with only 1{\%} reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

abstract = {In this paper, several spectral indices based on spectral reflectance data from the Terra satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor were evaluated in terms of their practical applicability for quantifying drought intensity and its geographical effects to support the drought monitoring applications. A total number of 358 MODIS 8-day composite images for the period between 2000 and 2014 were acquired and processed for the analysis; the frequency of drought phenomenon was increased during this time period. Vegetation indices, water indices, and combinations of both, which were called drought indices, were used. To validate the results, regression analyses were performed and Pearson's r values were calculated. The P{\'{a}}lfai Drought Index (PAI) and the average annual yields of different crops were used as reference data. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), the Difference Water Index (DWI), the Difference Drought Index (DDI), and the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) were found to be significant in quantifying drought intensity. Anomalies relative to the average of the period between 2000 and 2014 were calculated and standardized using the standard deviation, enabling the identification of above-average, drought-stricken areas. The results of this study can be used to create a cost-effective, near real-time and currently missing national drought monitoring system with high temporal resolution to detect regional climate changes, and to assess forest damage probability through changes in the chlorophyll and water content of forest vegetation.},

abstract = {Aim Treelines occur globally within a narrow range of mean growing season temperatures, suggesting that low-temperature growth limitation determines the position of the treeline. However, treelines also exhibit features that indicate that other mechanisms, such as biomass loss not resulting in mortality (dieback) and mortality, determine treeline position and dynamics. Debate regarding the mechanisms controlling treeline position and dynamics may be resolved by identifying the mechanisms controlling prominent treeline spatial patterns (or 'form') such as the spatial structure of the transition from closed forest to the tree limit. Recent treeline studies world-wide have confirmed a close link between form and dynamics. Location The concepts presented refer to alpine treelines globally. Methods In this review, we describe how varying dominance of three general 'first-level' mechanisms (tree performance: growth limitation, seedling mortality and dieback) result in different treeline forms, what 'second-level' mechanisms (stresses, e.g. freezing damage, photoinhibition) may underlie these general mechanisms, and how they are modulated by interactions with neighbours ('third-level' mechanisms). This hierarchy of mechanisms should facilitate discussions about treeline formation and dynamics. Results We distinguish four primary treeline forms: diffuse, abrupt, island and krummholz. Growth limitation is dominant only at the diffuse treeline, which is the form that has most frequently responded as expected to growing-season warming, whereas the other forms are controlled by dieback and seedling mortality and are relatively unresponsive. Main conclusions Treeline form provides a means for explaining the current variability in treeline position and dynamics and for exploring the general mechanisms controlling the responses of treelines to climatic change. Form indicates the relative dependence of tree performance on various aspects of the external climate (especially summer warmth versus winter stressors) and on internal feedbacks, thus allowing inferences on the type as well as strength of climate-change responses. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Studies of feedback between ecological pattern and process can benefit from the analysis of visually striking patterns, as they may reveal underlying processes and clarify the relative role of exogenous versus endogenous factors in driving vegetation change. Roughly linear forest patches are common in subalpine environments, including 'hedges', 'ribbon forest', and 'Shimagare' or 'wave regenerated forests' (waves). The influence of wind is common among these patterns, but the role of positive feedback, the most important component of self-organization in biological systems, varies. Hedges are orientated parallel to prevailing winds in several mid-latitude mountain ranges worldwide. Desiccation and ice-particle abrasion kills windward foliage while the vegetation shelters leeward seedlings and growth, so that the patches migrate slowly across the slope. Ribbon forest consists of strips orientated perpendicular to prevailing winds. They have been examined only in the US Rocky Mountains and are the least studied and understood of these phenomena. There are at least three distinct types of ribbon forest, which appear to develop in different ways. Waves are migrating strips of mortality and regeneration orientated perpendicular to prevailing winds in the USA, Japan and Argentina, and dominant controls vary by site. Hedges and waves can develop endogenously with a constant wind, and so can be considered self-organizing in the sense that feedback at the scale of individual trees creates a pattern across the scale of many trees without exogenous forcing. Most ribbon forests seem to be dominated by exogenous forces, but more work is needed to fully characterize the different types. {\textcopyright} 2008 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Elevational and polar treelines have been studied for more than two centuries. The aim of the present article is to highlight in retrospect the scope of treeline research, scientific approaches and hypotheses on treeline causation, its spatial structures and temporal change. Systematic treeline research dates back to the end of the 19th century. The abundance of global, regional, and local studies has provided a complex picture of the great variety and heterogeneity of both altitudinal and polar treelines. Modern treeline research started in the 1930s, with experimental field and laboratory studies on the trees' physiological response to the treeline environment. During the following decades, researchers' interest increasingly focused on the altitudinal and polar treeline dynamics to climate warming since the Little Ice Age. Since the 1970s interest in treeline dynamics again increased and has considerably intensified from the 1990s to today. At the same time, remote sensing techniques and GIS application have essentially supported previous analyses of treeline spatial patterns and temporal variation. Simultaneously, the modelling of treeline has been rapidly increasing, often related to the current treeline shift and and its implications for biodiversity, and the ecosystem function and services of high-elevation forests. It appears, that many seemingly 'new ideas' already originated many decades ago and just confirm what has been known for a long time. Suggestions for further research are outlined.},

abstract = {Northern and high-latitude alpine treelines are generally thought to be limited by available warmth. Most studies of tree-growth-climate interaction at treeline as well as climate reconstructions using dendrochronology report positive growth response of treeline trees to warmer temperatures. However, population-wide responses of treeline trees to climate remain largely unexamined. We systematically sampled 1558 white spruce at 13 treeline sites in the Brooks Range and Alaska Range. Our findings of both positive and negative growth responses to climate warming at treeline challenge the widespread assumption that arctic treeline trees grow better with warming climate. High mean temperatures in July decreased the growth of 40{\%} of white spruce at treeline areas in Alaska, whereas warm springs enhance growth of additional 36{\%} of trees and 24{\%} show no significant correlation with climate. Even though these opposing growth responses are present in all sampled sites, their relative proportion varies between sites and there is no overall clear relationship between growth response and landscape position within a site. Growth increases and decreases appear in our sample above specific temperature index values (temperature thresholds), which occurred more frequently in the late 20th century. Contrary to previous findings, temperature explained more variability in radial growth after 1950. Without accounting for these opposite responses and temperature thresholds, climate reconstructions based on ring width will miscalibrate past climate, and biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models will overestimate carbon uptake and treeline advance under future warming scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Site index values were generally higher than published values for similar sites. Numerous pests affected all species in the trials. Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) caused heavy mortality in lodgepole pine in part of one trial, and Armillaria root disease caused widespread damage to western larch and Douglas-fir in the other trial. Western white pine from local seed sources were severely damaged by white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) in both trials but a rust-resistant seed source used in one trial survived better. Frost damage reduced survival and growth of Douglas-fir in one trial and may have affected western white pine. Survival of two planted broadleaves (Betula papyrifera) and a hybrid of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and black poplar (Populus nigra) was severely reduced by drought. The results support ongoing efforts to broaden the number of species used in British Columbia reforestation programs.},

Species that have ample intraspecific genetic differentiation, such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), are expected to display population-specific growth responses to climate change. Using a mixed-effects modeling approach, we describe three-year height (HT) growth response to changes in climate of interior Douglas-fir populations. We incorporate climate information at the population level, yielding a model that is specific to both species and population. We use data from provenance tests from previous studies that comprised 236 populations from Idaho, Montana, and eastern Washington, USA. The most sensitive indicator of climate was the mean temperature of the coldest month. Population maximum HT and HT growth response to changes in climate were dependent on seed source climate. All populations had optimum HT growth when transferred to climates with warmer winters; those originating in sites with the warmest winters were taller across sites and had highest HT growth at transfer distances closest to zero; those from colder climates were shortest and had optimum HT growth when transferred the farthest. Although this differential response damped the height growth differences among populations, cold-climate populations still achieved their maximum growth at lower temperatures than warm-climate populations. The results highlight the relevance of understanding climate change impacts at the population level, particularly in a species with ample genetic variation among populations.},

Using tree-ring data collected from 33 stands of mature interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) spanning a wide climatic range in British Columbia (BC), Canada, we present an approach combining high-resolution spatiotemporal climate data with traditional dendroecological analyses to quantify relationships between population climate-growth sensitivity and provenance (i.e., seed-source origin) climate. Key results showed that Douglas-fir climate-growth sensitivities were strongly linked to provenance climate and varied in coherent patterns across climatic gradients. Climate-growth sensitivities and responses were sometimes opposite between provenances from disparate climates. Perhaps most importantly, our results showed that Douglas-fir productivity across most of its range was sensitive to moisture limitations, and this sensitivity increased strongly with decreasing provenance mean annual precipitation and increasing heat-moisture index. Using geographic information systems, we visualize the link between provenance mean annual precipitation and climatic sensitivity of Douglas-fir across BC to identify "high risk" populations. By understanding the link between biological responses and climate, forest managers may be able to spatially identify sensitive populations using spatiotemporal climate data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Radial growth of trees in mountainous areas is subject to conditions associated with changes in elevation. We present ring-width chronologies for Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) at nine sites spanning low to high elevations in the Bella Coola area of the central coast of British Columbia, near the northern limits of the species distribution, and investigate the variation in tree-ring growth patterns in relation to different elevations , using principal component (PC) analysis. We find that the first PC, which represents 55.6{\%} of the total variance, reflects a common growth response at sites of different elevation. Response function analysis indicates that growing season precipitation is the major factor in controlling tree-ring growth. This factor explains more of the variance in low-elevation sites than it does in high-elevation ones. Temperature in August of the preceding year shows a negative relationship to ring-width growth. The second PC represents 16.7{\%} of the total variance and reveals a distinct difference in growth response between low-and high-elevation sites. The length and temperature of the growing season seem to play an important role in tree-ring growth at sites of high elevation. Comparison of the Bella Coola records with those from southern Vancouver Island suggests that growing season precipitation influences growth of Douglas-fir on a macroregional scale, but other factors such as temperature modify the growth response at the limits of the distribution of the species.

abstract = {Aim Current interest in forecasting changes to species ranges has resulted in a multitude of approaches to species distribution models (SDMs). However, most approaches include only a small subset of the available information, and many ignore smaller-scale processes such as growth, fecundity and dispersal. Further-more, different approaches often produce divergent predictions with no simple method to reconcile them. Here, we present a flexible framework for integrating models at multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian methods. Location Eastern North America (as an example). Methods Our framework builds a metamodel that is constrained by the results of multiple sub-models and provides probabilistic estimates of species presence. We applied our approach to a simulated dataset to demonstrate the integration of a correlative SDM with a theoretical model. In a second example, we built an inte-grated model combining the results of a physiological model with presence– absence data for sugar maple (Acer saccharum), an abundant tree native to eastern North America. Results For both examples, the integrated models successfully included informa-tion from all data sources and substantially improved the characterization of uncer-tainty. For the second example, the integrated model outperformed the source models with respect to uncertainty when modelling the present range of the species. When projecting into the future, the model provided a consensus view of two models that differed substantially in their predictions. Uncertainty was reduced where the models agreed and was greater where they diverged, providing a more realistic view of the state of knowledge than either source model. Main conclusions We conclude by discussing the potential applications of our method and its accessibility to applied ecologists. In ideal cases, our framework can be easily implemented using off-the-shelf software. The framework has wide poten-tial for use in species distribution modelling and can drive better integration of multi-source and multi-scale data into ecological decision-making.},

abstract = {For over 100 years, mountain treelines have been the subject of varied research endeavors and remain a strong area of investigation. The purpose of this paper is to examine aspects of the epistemology of mountain treeline research-that is, to investigate how knowledge on treelines has been acquired and the changes in knowledge acquisition over time, through a review of fundamental questions and approaches. The questions treeline researchers have raised and continue to raise have undoubtedly directed the current state of knowledge. A continuing, fundamental emphasis has centered on seeking the general cause of mountain treelines, thus seeking an answer to the question, "What causes treeline?" with a primary emphasis on searching for ecophysiological mechanisms of low-temperature limitation for tree growth and regeneration. However, treeline research today also includes a rich literature that seeks local, landscape-scale causes of treelines and reasons why treelines vary so widely in three-dimensional patterns from one location to the next, and this approach and some of its consequences are elaborated here. In recent years, both lines of research have been motivated greatly by global climate change. Given the current state of knowledge, we propose that future research directions focused on a spatial approach should specifically address cross-scale hypotheses using statistics and simulations designed for nested hierarchies; these analyses will benefit from geographic extension of treeline research. {\textcopyright} 2011 Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research.},

The study area is currently a relatively warm and dry region of {\{}Germany{\}}. We calculated species distribution models (SDMs) using information on species� climate envelopes to predict regional species spectra under 63 different climate change scenarios. We complemented this with fine-scale ecological niche analysis using data from 51 vegetation surveys in seven forest reserves in the study area, and tree-ring analysis (TRA) from local populations of five tree species to quantify their sensitivity to climatic extreme years. The SDMs showed that predicted future climate change in the region remains within the climate envelope of certain species (e.g. Quercus petraea), whilst for e.g. Fagus sylvatica, future climate conditions in one third of the scenarios are too warm and dry. This was confirmed by the TRA: sensitivity to drought periods is lower for Q. petraea than for F. sylvatica. The niche analysis shows that the local ecological niches of Quercus robur and Fraxinus excelsior are mainly characterized by soils providing favorable water supply than by climate, and Pinus sylvestris (planted) is strongly influenced by light availability. The best adapted species for a warmer and potentially drier climate in the study region are Acer campestre, Sorbus torminalis, S. aria, Ulmus minor, and Tilia platyphyllos, which should therefore play a more prominent role in future climate-resilient mixed forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {The general trend of climatically-driven treeline advance is modified by regional, local and temporal variations. Treelines will not advance in a closed front parallel to the shift of any isotherm to higher elevations and more northern latitudes. The effects of varying topography on site conditions and the after-effects of historical disturbances by natural and anthropogenic factors may override the effects of slightly higher average temperatures. Moreover, the varying treeline-forming species respond in different ways to a changing climate. Forest advance upwards and northwards primarily depends on successful regeneration and survival of young growth rather than on increasing growth rates of mature trees. Every assessment of treeline response to future climate change must consider the effects of local site conditions and feedbacks of increasing tree population in modulating the climatically-driven change. Treeline-shift will influence regional and local climates, pedogenesis, plant communities, animal populations and biodiversity as well as having a considerable effect on economic changes in primary production. A better understanding of the functional relationships between the many treeline-relevant factors and treeline dynamics can be achieved only by extensive research at different scales within different climatic regions supported by as many as possible experimental studies in the field together with laboratory and remote sensing techniques.},

abstract = {While aerial photography and satellite imagery are the usual data sources used in remote sensing, land based oblique photographs can also be used to measure ecological change. By using such historical photographs, the time frame for change detection can be extended into the late 1800s and early 1900s, predating the era of aerial imagery by decades. Recent advancements in computing power have enabled the development of techniques for georeferencing oblique angle photographs. The WSL Monoplotting Tool is a new piece of software that opens the door to analyzing such photographs by allowing for extraction of spatially referenced vector data from oblique photographs. A very large repeat photography collection based on the world's largest systematic collection of historical mountain topographic survey images, the Mountain Legacy Project, contains {\textgreater}6000 high resolution oblique image pairs showing landscape changes in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta between ca. 1900 - today. We used a subset of photographs from this collection to assess the accuracy and utility of the WSL Monoplotting Tool for georeferencing oblique photographs and measuring landscape change. We determined that the tool georeferenced objects to within less than 15m of their real world 3D spatial location, and the displacement of the geographic center of over 121 control points was less than 3m from the real world spatial location. Most of the error in individual object placement was due to the angle of viewing incidence with the ground (i.e., low angle/highly oblique angles resulted in greater horizontal error). Simple rules of control point selection are proposed to reduce georeferencing errors. We further demonstrate a method by which raster data can be rapidly extracted from an image pair to measure changes in vegetation cover over time. This new process permits the rapid evaluation of a large number of images to facilitate landscape scale analysis of oblique imagery.},

As an example of typical data where such analyses have proven useful, we apply the methods to the Arctic Oscillation index and the Baltic maximum sea ice extent record.

@article{Kambo2018,
abstract = {Several mechanistic hypotheses have been developed to explain the
existence of alpine treelines worldwide. The reproduction limitation
hypothesis (RLH) postulates that reproductive processes such as seed
production and dispersal are restricted in treeline environments,
thereby limiting the establishment of new individuals in advance of
extant treelines. Despite its popularity, no study has tested this
hypothesis in a comprehensive fashion. In this experiment, we attempted
to answer whether there are enough viable seeds being dispersed beyond
treeline for sexually mediated treeline advance, and what the
implications of climate change might be on these processes.
We established 30 plots across two aspects (north vs. south) and three
elevational habitats (forest, treeline and tundra) in a white spruce
(Picea glauca) boreal forest-alpine tundra ecotone in southwest Yukon,
Canada. In each plot, tree characteristics, seed production and
predispersal damage were measured. Additionally, eight dispersal trays
were positioned in each plot to measure seed rain, and germination
trials with and without predation exclosures were constructed in a
subset of plots to quantify dispersal and germination success.
Results were highly variable both temporally and spatially. In 2014, a
mast year, 69{\%} of adult trees produced cones compared to 0.4{\%} in the
following year. Higher density of trees in forest plots compared to
treeline and tundra resulted in greater seed production at lower
elevations. Across all plots, 88{\%} of seeds were damaged before
dispersal or were not viable. Treeline plots had significantly greater
predispersal damage. Seed rain was greater in south-facing plots than
north-facing plots. Less than 2{\%} of seeds produced on the landscape
were dispersed into Tundra plots, located 50 m above treeline. There was
a net movement of seeds from the north-facing slope to the south at our
study site, likely due to prevailing winds during the dispersal period.
Germination counts were more than double on north-facing slopes and
one-third higher inside exclosures. Cumulatively, the results provide
some evidence for the RLH. Collectively, the high amount of predispersal
damage and non-viable seeds, variability associated with dispersal and
significant seed predation can functionally influence treeline dynamics.
These findings suggest that global treeline distribution models, which
rely largely on temperature, may not be entirely accurate for predicting
treeline advance-at least at finer temporal scales. Many stochastic
factors need to align temporally for successful advance, which is likely
to result in a lag of many decades between the period of temperature
amelioration and an increased number of trees beyond extant treelines.},

abstract = {Forests strongly affect Earth's carbon cycles, making our ability to forecast forest-productivity changes associated with rising temperatures and changes in precipitation increasingly critical. In this study, we model the influence of climate on annual radial growth using lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees grown for 34 years in a large provenance experiment in western Canada. We use a random-coefficient modeling approach to build universal growth-trend response functions that simultaneously incorporate the impacts of different provenance and site climates on radial growth trends under present and future annual (growth-year), summer, and winter climate regimes. This approach provides new depth to traditional quantitative genetics population response functions by illustrating potential changes in population dominance over time, as well as indicating the age and size at which annual growth begins declining for any population growing in any location under any present or future climate scenario within reason, given the ages and climatic conditions sampled. Our models indicate that lodgepole pine radial-growth levels maximize between 3.9° and 5.1° mean growth-year temperature. This translates to productivity declining by the mid-21st century in southern and central British Columbia (BC), while increasing beyond the 2080s in northern BC and Yukon, as temperatures rise. Relative to summer climate indices, productivity is predicted to decline continuously through the 2080s in all locations, while relative to winter climate variables, the opposite trend occurs, with the growth increases caused by warmer winters potentially offsetting the summer losses. Trees from warmer provenances, i.e., from the center of the species range, perform best in nearly all of our present and future climate-scenario models. We recommend that similar models be used to analyze population growth trends relative to annual and intra-annual climate in other large-scale provenance trials worldwide. An open-access growth-trend data set encompassing numerous biomes, species, and provenances would contribute substantially to predicting forest productivity under future-climate scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Ongoing climatic changes potentially affect tree-line ecosystems, but in many regions the observed changes are superimposed by human activities. We assessed how the forest-tundra ecotone has changed during the last century in the Putorana Mountains, northern Siberia, an extremely remote and untouched area in Eurasia. A space-for-time approach was used to determine the spatio-temporal dynamics of forest structure and biomass along an altitudinal transect. From the closed larch forest to the upper tree line, the mean age of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) decreased considerably from 220 to 50 years ago. At the current upper species line, there is a strong and successful germination of larch, with 1500 saplings per hectare, indicating an ongoing filling-in, a densification of a formerly open forest and an upslope shift of the tree-line position (approximately 30 to 50m in altitude during the last century). The forest expansion coincided with large increases in winter precipitation during the 20th century. In contrast, tree growth rates were significantly positively related to summer temperatures, neither of which increased markedly. The total aboveground biomass decreased from approximately 40tha -1 in the closed larch forest to 5tha -1 at the tree line. Our study demonstrates that ongoing climatic changes lead to an upslope expansion of forests in the remote Putorana Mountains, which alters the stand structure and productivity of the forest-tundra ecotone. These vegetation changes are very probably of minor importance for aboveground carbon sequestration, but soil carbon data are needed to estimate the impact of the forest expansion on the total ecosystem carbon storage. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Mountain caribou, an ecotype of woodland caribou, are endangered due to the loss and fragmentation of old forests on which they depend. However, a wider array of natural and human factors may limit caribou persistence and isolate populations, and understanding these may help to stop or reverse population declines by forecasting risk and targeting core habitat areas and key linkages for protection, enhancement or restoration. Across most of the historic range of mountain caribou, we conducted a bi-level analysis to evaluate factors related to the persistence of, and landscape occupancy within, remaining subpopulations. We used caribou location data from 235 radio-collared animals across 13 subpopulations to derive a landscape occupancy index, while accounting for inherent sampling biases. We analyzed this index against 33 landscape variables of forest overstory, land cover, terrain, climate, and human influence. At the metapopulation level, the persistence of subpopulations relative to historic range was explained by the extent of wet and very wet climatic conditions, the distribution of both old ({\textgreater}140 yr) forests, particularly of cedar and hemlock composition, and alpine areas. Other important factors were remoteness from human presence, low road density, and little motorized access. At the subpopulation level, the relative intensity of caribou landscape occupancy within subpopulation bounds was explained by the distribution of old cedar/hemlock and spruce/subalpine fir forests and the lack of deciduous forests. Other factors impeding population contiguity were icefields, non-forested alpine, hydro reservoirs, extensive road networks, and primary highway routes. Model outputs at both levels were combined to predict the potential for mountain caribou population persistence, isolation, and restoration. We combined this output with the original occupancy index to gauge the potential vulnerability of caribou to extirpation within landscapes known to have recently supported animals. We discuss implications as they pertain to range-wide caribou population connectivity and conservation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The Canadian boreal forests, which occupy about 30{\%} of the boreal forests worldwide and 77{\%} of Canada's total forested land, play a critical role in the albedo of Earth's surface and in its global carbon budget. Many of the previously reported regional-scale impacts of drought on tree mortality have affected low- and middle-latitude tropical regions and the temperate forests of the western United States, but no study has examined high-latitude boreal regions with multiple species at a regional scale using long-term forest permanent sampling plots. Here, we estimated tree mortality in natural stands throughout Canada's boreal forests using data from the permanent sampling plots and statistical models. We found that tree mortality rates increased by an overall average of 4.7{\%} yr -1 from 1963 to 2008, with higher mortality rate increases in western regions than in eastern regions (about 4.9 and 1.9{\%} yr -1, respectively). The water stress created by regional drought may be the dominant contributor to these widespread increases in tree mortality rates across tree species, sizes, elevations, longitudes and latitudes. Western Canada seems to have been more sensitive to drought than eastern Canada. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understory growth dynamics of northern conifer species were studied in four stands managed under multiaged silvicultural systems in eastern Maine. Height growth of Picea rubens Sarg., Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr. saplings between 0.5 and 6.0 m in height was related to the proportion open sky (POS), using sapling height as a covariate. Height growth of T. canadensis equaled A. balsamea and exceeded P. rubens under very low light levels (POS {\textless} 0.1) but is much less responsive to both increasing POS and taller heights, reaching 50{\%} of its maximum height growth at a POS of only 0.09. Abies balsamea outgrew P. rubens under similar dark conditions; at higher light levels (POS {\textgreater} 0.10), both species grew similarly. Evidently, no feasible overstory manipulation of light alone can promote more rapid height development of P. rubens saplings over A. balsamea. A nonlinear light-prediction model using stand basal area is linked with height-growth prediction equations to quantify sapling development from 0.5 to 6 m. Depending on overstory density, P. rubens requires a height advantage of 0.14-0.33 m over a 0.5 m tall A. balsamea to reach a height of 6 m over the same time period. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {Aim: Most studies focusing on the alpine tree line responses to climate warming have used either the tree densification within the ecotone or its elevational upshift as indicators. However, it is acknowledged that the relationship between densification and upshift is spatially heterogeneous, making inferences and comparability among studies tricky. The lack of consistent empirical evidence on this potential mismatch and its drivers leads us to focus on this issue in this study. The aim was twofold: (a) to quantify the mismatch between the two processes at a regional scale, and (b) to identify its site-specific determinants. Taxon: Pinus uncinata (Ramond ex DC.). Location: French eastern Pyrenees. Methods: An object-oriented supervised classification procedure was performed on historical (1953) and current (2015) aerial photographs. Based on the resulting rasters, densification of the tree line ecotone and upward shift of the tree line were estimated at the two dates in 191 sites, then standardized, before finally being compared. Three site clusters were derived (no mismatch, densification prevalence and upshift prevalence). After having characterized their spatial patterns through join count statistics, a multinomial logistic regression model was computed to identify the correlates of these clusters among a list of site variables. Results: No spatial pattern among the categories of responses emerges at a local scale, but buffers with no mismatch tend to aggregate at a larger scale. Changes in minimum air temperatures, site elevation, mean slope, slope morphometry and lithology appear as significant drivers of the observed mismatch, implying that the relationship between densification and elevational upshift is context specific. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that both densification and upshift should be considered in quantitative analyses of tree line spatial dynamics, since these two ecological processes are not controlled by the same drivers.},

abstract = {Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term ({\textgreater}50 yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives. As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems , such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity.},

abstract = {Growth response of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) to climate was studied across its local geographical and elevation range in the Olympic Mountains, Washington. A dendroecological analysis of subalpine fir across a range of elevations (1350‐1850 m) and annual precipitation (125‐350 cm y−1), was used to compare environmental factors affecting growth. Climate‐growth relationships were explored using Pearson product‐moment correlation coefficients; partial correlation analysis was used to assess relationships among site chronologies and climatic variables. Radial growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation at high elevation and wet sites, but not at low and middle elevation dry sites. Growth is positively correlated with current growing season temperature at all sites; however, growth is negatively correlated with previous year August temperature, indicating that climate affects growth in subsequent years. Positive correlations between growth and summer precipitation during the growing season at low and middle elevation dry sites suggest that soil moisture is partially limiting to growth on these sites. If the climate of the Pacific Northwest becomes warmer and drier, then subalpine fir growth may increase at high elevation and wet sites, but may decrease at lower elevation dry sites in the Olympic Mountains. However, the growth response of subalpine fir to potentially rapid climate change will not be uniform because subalpine fir grows over a wide range of topographic features, habitats, and local climates at different geographical scales. A comparison of growth response to current growing season temperature suggests that the temperature‐related growth response of subalpine fir is not adequately described by the parabolic curve used in JABOWA‐based models.

Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) can accelerate the rate of change in mountain ecosystems, cryospheric systems, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Here we review important mechanisms that contribute towards EDW: snow albedo and surface-based feedbacks; water vapour changes and latent heat release; surface water vapour and radiative flux changes; surface heat loss and temperature change; and aerosols. All lead to enhanced warming with elevation (or at a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW.

abstract = {Understanding how vulnerable forest ecosystems are to climate change is a key requirement if sustainable forest management is to be achieved. Modelling the response of species in their regeneration niche to phenological and biophysical processes that are directly influenced by climate is one method for achieving this understanding. A model was developed to investigate species resilience and vulnerability to climate change within its fundamental-regeneration niche. The utility of the developed model, tree and climate assessment (TACA), was tested within the interior Douglas-fir ecosystem in south-central British Columbia. TACA modelled the current potential tree species composition of the ecosystem with high accuracy and modelled significant responses amongst tree species to climate change. The response of individual species suggests that the studied ecosystem could transition to a new ecosystem over the next 100 years. TACA showed that it can be an effective tool for identifying species resilience and vulnerability to changes in climate within the most sensitive stage of development, the regeneration phase. The TACA model was able to identify the degree of change in phenological and biophysical variables that control tree establishment, growth and persistence. The response to changes in one or more of these variables resulted in changes in the climatic suitability of the ecosystem for species and enabled a measure of vulnerability to be quantified. TACA could be useful to forest managers as a decision support tool for adaptation actions and by researchers interested in modelling stand dynamics under climate change. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The pattern of conifer establishment and the potential role of positive plant interactions in tree islands at alpine treeline are examined at three treeline locations in Glacier National Park. Tree island development is often initiated by the establishment of a conifer near a microtopographic shelter source, and subsequent establishment creates a linear, series-like pattern in the lee of previously established trees. First-order Markov analysis of series pattern of established individuals in tree islands demonstrates relative stability or self-perpetuation of many of the early-established individuals, lowering the number of predominant vegetation classes. Embedded Markov analysis, however, suggests that the establishment of conifers within a patch does not follow a predictable spatial sequence; however, Pinus albicaulis, a foundation and keystone species, occupies sites immediately behind shelters more than other species and therefore may facilitate subsequent conifer establishment. The spatial patterns of these treeline series are highly variable with study sites, as would be expected from the highly variable local environments of these sites and a largely structural facilitation regime. Where species richness and patch dynamism is high, there may be greater potential for treeline advance on a coarse scale than there is at sites with low species richness. Low richness sites may be more susceptible to stochastic disturbance events that would disrupt conifer establishment and survival. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An increased pressure to use silvicultural techniques not based on clear-cutting followed by planting has led to an interest in systems that take advantage of existing understory seedlings (advance regeneration). Earlier studies have suggested that following harvesting, understory seedlings may experience growth reductions before responding with growth increases. We hypothesize that this "growth shock" following release results because seedlings are ill adjusted to the new growing conditions and that this can be investigated through a comparison of growth in different parts of the tree over a 6-year period. This study compares the growth response of three size classes of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings to a partial overstory removal in relatively dry conifer forests of central British Columbia. Growth was evaluated in four parts of the studied trees: radial increment in roots, in the base of the stem, and in branches, as well as leader height growth extension. Our findings show that following release from the overstory, early growth increases were largest in the roots and stems irrespective of the species or the size class. Differences between the species were observed in greater absolute height growth for pine, whereas Douglas-fir invested in greater stem growth, especially in the larger individuals. Important differences also occurred temporally. Both species (and all size classes) responded with an immediate increase in root growth followed, after a 1-year delay, by an increase in stem growth. Branch radial increment (for pine) and leader height growth (both species), however, experienced 2 to 3 year growth reductions before responding. It is therefore suggested that individuals restore the root-shoot balance by greater initial investments to root growth to offset the increased transpiration losses associated with the greater light and higher temperature conditions and the relative changes in the photosynthetic versus nutrient uptake capacity following the canopy opening. Foresters may therefore be able to manipulate tree growth responses by using an appropriate degree of overstory removal or opening size.},

Looking beyond tree growth to underlying physiological mechanisms is fundamental for accurate predictions of forest responses to climate warming and drought stress. Within a 32-year genetic field trial, we analyze relative contributions of xylem plasticity and inferred stomatal response to drought tolerance in regional populations of a widespread conifer. Genetic adaptation leads to varying responses under drought. Trailing-edge tree populations produce fewer tracheids with thicker cell walls, characteristic of drought-tolerance. Stomatal response explains the moderate drought tolerance of tree populations in central areas of the species range. Growth loss of the northern population is linked to low stomatal responsiveness combined with the production of tracheids with thinner cell walls. Forests of the western boreal may therefore lack physiological adaptations necessary to tolerate drier conditions.},

Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52{\%} of sites with only 1{\%} reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

abstract = {Large-scale biogeographical shifts in vegetation are predicted in response to the altered precipitation and temperature regimes associated with global climate change. Vegetation shifts have profound ecological impacts and are an important climate-ecosystem feedback through their alteration of carbon, water, and energy exchanges of the land surface. Of particular concern is the potential for warmer temperatures to compound the effects of increasingly severe droughts by triggering widespread vegetation shifts via woody plant mortality. The sensitivity of tree mortality to temperature is dependent on which of 2 non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms predominates - temperature-sensitive carbon starvation in response to a period of protracted water stress or temperature-insensitive sudden hydraulic failure under extreme water stress (cavitation). Here we show that experimentally induced warmer temperatures (≈4 °C) shortened the time to drought-induced mortality in Pinus edulis (pinon shortened pine) trees by nearly a third, with temperature-dependent differences in cumulative respiration costs implicating carbon starvation as the primary mechanism of mortality. Extrapolating this temperature effect to the historic frequency of water deficit in the southwestern United States predicts a 5-fold increase in the frequency of regional-scale tree die-off events for this species due to temperature alone. Projected increases in drought frequency due to changes in precipitation and increases in stress from biotic agents (e.g., bark beetles) would further exacerbate mortality. Our results demonstrate the mechanism by which warmer temperatures have exacerbated recent regional die-off events and background mortality rates. Because of pervasive projected increases in temperature, our results portend widespread increases in the extent and frequency of vegetation die-off.},

abstract = {Intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in tree rings are generally considered structural anomalies caused by deviations from the “normal course” of xylo- genesis during the growing season. This definition is based on the bias that, under “normal conditions”, cambial activity stops once a year. Each tree ring can thus be dated to one calendar year, which is one of the principles of dendro- chronology. The formation of IADFs can be triggered directly by environmental changes, especially in precipitation and temperature, that affect cambial activity and cell differentiation. It can also be the result of limited photosynthesis, due to defoliation induced by biotic or abiotic constraints. Often indicated with alternative terms, IADFs were first described in the 1930s, and recently reported for many trees and shrubs from different ecosystems throughout the world, particularly for Mediterranean species. Different types of IADFs have been detected; their formation and structural properties depend on many factors including tree genotype, age, size, rooting depth, habitat, soil, climate, photosynthetic activity, and allocation strategies. Whether IADFs affect the adaptive capability of plants remains, however, unclear. We provide an overview of the main anatomical features of IADFs and their occurrence in tree rings from various environments and climatic regimes. We propose a simplified way of classifying them and discuss the hypotheses about their functional role and the factors triggering their formation. To understand the ecological role of IADFs better, we recommend a multidisciplinary approach,involving wood anatomy, dendroecology, and stable isotopes, which has already been applied for Mediterranean species. We conclude by considering that IADFs appear to be the “rule” rather than “anomalies” in some ecosystems where they help plants cope with fluctuating environmental conditions. Moreover, their anatomical structure represents a valuable proxy of past climatic conditions at a sub-seasonal resolution and may be relevant to adapt hydraulic functioning of living trees to changing climatic conditions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author 2015. The shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) is a species commonly targeted by commercial and recreational anglers in many parts of the developed world. In Australia, the species is targeted by recreational anglers only, under the assumption that most of the sharks are released and populations remain minimally impacted. If released sharks do not survive, the current management strategy will need to be revised. Shortfin mako sharks are commonly subjected to lengthy angling events; however, their endothermic physiology may provide an advantage over ectothermic fishes when recovering from exercise. This study assessed the post-release survival of recreationally caught shortfin mako sharks using Survivorship Pop-up Archival Transmitting (sPAT) tags and examined physiological indicators of capture stress from blood samples as well as any injuries that may be caused by hook selection. Survival estimates were based on 30 shortfin mako sharks captured off the southeastern coast of Australia. Three mortalities were observed over the duration of the study, yielding an overall survival rate of 90{\%}. All mortalities occurred in sharks angled for {\textless} 30 min. Sharks experienced increasing plasma lactate with longer fight times and higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs), increased plasma glucose at higher SSTs and depressed expression of heat shock protein 70 and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate at higher SSTs. Long fight times did not impact survival. Circle hooks significantly reduced foul hooking when compared with J hooks. Under the conditions of this study, we found that physical injury associated with hook choice is likely to have contributed to an increased likelihood of mortality, whereas the high aerobic scope associated with the species' endothermy probably enabled it to cope with long fight times and the associated physiological responses to capture.},

abstract = {Radial growth of trees in mountainous areas is subject to conditions associated with changes in elevation. We present ring-width chronologies for Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) at nine sites spanning low to high elevations in the Bella Coola area of the central coast of British Columbia, near the northern limits of the species distribution, and investigate the variation in tree-ring growth patterns in relation to different elevations, using principal component (PC) analysis. We find that the first PC, which represents 55.6{\%} of the total variance, reflects a common growth response at sites of different elevation. Response function analysis indicates that growing season precipitation is the major factor in controlling tree-ring growth. This factor explains more of the variance in low-elevation sites than it does in high-elevation ones. Temperature in August of the preceding year shows a negative relationship to ring-width growth. The second PC represents 16.7{\%} of the total variance and reveals a distinct difference in growth response between low- and high-elevation sites. The length and temperature of the growing season seem to play an important role in tree-ring growth at sites of high elevation. Comparison of the Bella Coola records with those from southern Vancouver Island suggests that growing season precipitation influences growth of Douglas-fir on a macroregional scale, but other factors such as temperature modify the growth response at the limits of the distribution of the species.},

We hypothesized that drought stress due to the 2003 or 2006 European heat waves were the triggers for tree decline and focused analyses on the structure of wood that was produced after, as well as before, signs of stress, i.e., when decreases in height or diameter growth were visible. In the data set comprising previously published and new measurements, P50, i.e., the pressure potential necessary to induce a 50{\%} loss in hydraulic conductivity, was negatively related to wood density. Declining trees produced wider annual rings with lower density than vigorous trees before their radial and height increment started to decline in 2003 or 2006. Trees that produced low-density wood under favorable water availability were more stressed by a sudden drought event because of higher P50 values in their sapwood. Due to the strong genotypic relationship between wood density and growth, we suggest that spruce trees selected for fast growth might experience limited hydraulic performance under the impact of extreme heat waves.},

As air temperature increases, evaporative demand also increases, increasing effective drought in forest ecosystems. Using a spatially comprehensive network of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) chronologies from 122 locations that represent distinct climate environments in the western United States, we show that increased temperature decreases growth via vapor pressure deficit (VPD) across all latitudes. Using an ensemble of global circulation models, we project an increase in both the mean VPD associated with the lowest growth extremes and the probability of exceeding these VPD values. As temperature continues to increase in future decades, we can expect deficit-related stress to increase and consequently Douglas fir growth to decrease throughout its US range.},

abstract = {Temporal changes in stand growth dominance, i.e. a measure of the relative contribution of different-sized trees to the total stand growth, may play a role in the commonly observed decline in forest productivity over time through a shift in resource acquisition and utilization between dominant and non-dominant trees. We hypothesized that the expected decreases in both growth dominance (GD) and relative growth rate (RGR) over time were related to decreases in leaf biomass of dominant trees or increases in allocation to leaf biomass of non-dominant trees. To better understand these potential relationships, we quantified stand growth dominance and some functional components (specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio, net assimilation rate, nitrogen per unit leaf area and nitrogen use efficiency) of the relative growth rate of dominant and non-dominant trees along forest development stages in the eastern Canadian boreal forest using a 1067-year-long post-fire chronosequence. As expected, stand growth dominance decreased with stand development, and was closely related to differences in RGR between dominant and non-dominant trees. Decline in both growth dominance and differences in RGR between 100 and 200 years after fire was related to greater biomass partitioning to leaves in non-dominant trees, coupled to better light acquisition capacity of non-dominant trees, which appeared in stands that were {\textgreater}75-years-old. In old-growth stands, the growth advantage of non-dominant trees over dominant trees involved other mechanisms, such as higher photosynthetic rates and better resource use efficiency in the non-dominant trees. Overall, the observed decrease in stand growth dominance with increasing age was explained mainly by declining resource acquisition and utilization in dominant trees rather than through improved resource acquisition and utilization of non-dominant trees.},

The model uses as input only 11 sets of monthly normal statistics from individual weather stations. It needs no calibration, and was parameterized and validated for use in Canada and the continental United States. Monthly normals needed are: mean and standard deviation of daily minimum and maximum temperature, first and second order autoregressive terms for daily deviations of minimum and maximum temperatures from their daily means, correlation of deviations of daily minimum and maximum temperatures, total precipitation, and the interannual variance of total precipitation. The statistical properties and distributions of daily temperature and precipitation data produced by this generator compared quite favorably with observations from 708 stations throughout North America (north of Mexico). The algorithm generates realistic seasonal patterns, variability and extremes of temperature, precipitation, frost-free periods and hot spells. However, it predicts less accurately the daily probability of precipitation, extreme precipitation events and the duration of extreme droughts.},

abstract = {Climate warming and the occurrence of more severe dry spells are causing widespread drought-induced forest die-off events. Despite research on drought-triggered die-off processes is rapidly increasing, little is known on how soil conditions and rhizosphere features are affected by canopy dieback and tree death. We studied the soils in the rhizosphere of three coniferous forests where die-off was induced by a severe drought in 2012. We selected three forest types subjected to contrasting climatic and edaphic conditions dominated by three different tree species: silver fir (Abies alba; temperate conditions), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris; continental and Mediterranean conditions) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis; semi-arid and Mediterranean conditions). In each forest, we analyzed soil physical characteristics such as water retention capacity and soil texture, nutrient availability and microbial community structure (Phospholipid fatty acids, PLFA) below non-declining and declining or dying trees. We did not observe differences in nutrient availability between the two vigor classes. Conversely, we found strong differences in soil microbial community structure below non-declining and declining trees in the Silver fir and Aleppo pine stands. Soils in the Scots pine stand presented extremely low values of soil saturated sorptivity indicating a reduction of soil water infiltration after prolonged dry periods which could exacerbate drought stress. We conclude that forest dieback impacts the soil microbial community structure in the short term. Further research is required to understand the linkages between a reduced capacity of soil water infiltration after prolonged droughts, short-term changes in the soil microbiota, long-term nutrient imbalances and tree death. Soil conditions shall be considered as an important part of forest management strategies after drought-induced die off.},

abstract = {We used data from 142 stands in Colorado and Wyoming, USA, to test the expectations of a model of growth dominance and stand development. Growth dominance relates the distribution of growth rates of individual trees within a stand to tree sizes. Stands with large trees that account for a greater share of stand growth than of stand mass exhibit strong growth dominance. Stands with large trees that contribute less to stand growth than to stand mass show reverse growth dominance. The four-phase model predicts that forests move from a period of little dominance (Phase 1), with trees accounting for similar contributions to stand growth and stand mass. Phase 2 is a period of strong growth dominance, where larger trees account for a disproportionately large amount of total stand growth. Growth dominance declines during Phase 3 as growth of the larger trees slows. A final Phase 4 shows reverse growth dominance when the growth of larger trees is less than their proportional contribution to total stand mass. The datasets supported the expectation of reverse growth dominance in old forests of ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and mixed stands of aspen and conifers. Pure aspen stands did not show reverse growth dominance. An age sequence of lodgepole pine failed to show the expected Phase 2 period of strongly developed growth dominance. Future work needs to combine quantitative descriptions of patterns in growth dominance with experimental manipulations of resource supplies and environmental conditions to connect forest dynamics at the scales of individual trees, groups of trees, and stands. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Whilst it is clear that increasing temperatures from global environmental change will impact the positions of alpine treelines, it is likely that a range of regional and local scaled factors will mediate the overall impact of global scale climate drivers. We summarized 12 categories of abiotic and biotic factors as 4 groups determining treeline positions. First, there are global factors related to climate-induced growth limitation and carbon limitation. Second, there are seven regional and local factors related to treeline dynamics including frost stress, topography, water stress, snow, wind, fire and non- fire disturbance. Third, species-specific factors can control treeline dynamics through their influence on reproduction and life history traits. Fourth, there are positive feedbacks in structuring the dynamics of treelines. Globally, the commonly accepted growth limitation hypothesis is that growth at a treeline is limited by temperature. Meanwhile, positive feedbacks between canopy cover and tree establishment are likely to control the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of many treelines. The presence of non-linear dynamics at treelines has implications for the use of treelines as barometers of climate change because the lagged responses and abrupt shifts inherent in non-equilibrium systems may combine to mask the overall climate trend.},

abstract = {A central challenge in global change research is the projection of the future behavior of a system based upon past observations. Tree-ring data have been used increasingly over the last decade to project tree growth and forest ecosystem vulnerability under future climate conditions. But how can the response of tree growth to past climate variation predict the future, when the future does not look like the past? Space-for-time substitution (SFTS) is one way to overcome the problem of extrapolation: the response at a given location in a warmer future is assumed to follow the response at a warmer location today. Here we evaluated an SFTS approach to projecting future growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), a species that occupies an exceptionally large environmental space in North America. We fit a hierarchical mixed-effects model to capture ring-width variability in response to spatial and temporal variation in climate. We found opposing gradients for productivity and climate sensitivity with highest growth rates and weakest response to interannual climate variation in the mesic coastal part of Douglas-fir's range; narrower rings and stronger climate sensitivity occurred across the semi-arid interior. Ring-width response to spatial versus temporal temperature variation was opposite in sign, suggesting that spatial variation in productivity, caused by local adaptation and other slow processes, cannot be used to anticipate changes in productivity caused by rapid climate change. We thus substituted only climate sensitivities when projecting future tree growth. Growth declines were projected across much of Douglas-fir's distribution, with largest relative decreases in the semiarid U.S. Interior West and smallest in the mesic Pacific Northwest. We further highlight the strengths of mixed-effects modeling for reviving a conceptual cornerstone of dendroecology, Cook's 1987 aggregate growth model, and the great potential to use tree-ring networks and results as a calibration target for next-generation vegetation models.},

Using SORTIE-ND, a spatially explicit stand dynamics model, we simulated 100-year development patterns following different partial harvesting treatments in two trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx)-dominated stands in eastern Canada, one 76-year old (pure aspen) and the other 90 years old (mixed aspen). The two stand types differed primarily in the nature of their understory: pure aspen stands had little advance conifer growth and a dense understory of a woody shrub species whereas mixed aspen stands were characterized by a dense regeneration layer of shade-tolerant conifers. To do this, we first evaluated model performance using short (12 years) and long (168 years) term empirical data. We then modelled stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvesting treatments of different intensities (33, 61 and 80{\%} basal area removal), and gap sizes (400, 900 and 1600m2). Following mortality of the first cohort of aspen, simulations projected dominance of conifer species, white spruce in particular, in unharvested controls of pure aspen stands and balsam fir in mixed aspen stands. Aspen recruitment increased with intensity of partial harvesting. All gap treatments and the 80{\%} dispersed harvesting favored recruitment of aspen over conifer species. After 100-year simulation runs, the 1600m2 gap treatment resulted in highest stand basal areas, 38.0 and 34.1m2ha-1, of which 18{\%} and 28{\%} consisted of intermediate- to shade-tolerant conifer species in pure aspen stands and in mixed aspen stands, respectively. Concerns surrounding partial harvesting have tended to focus on absolute retention levels and standing residence times of trees; however, our results demonstrate that both stand structure and timber production rates are influenced not only by retention levels after partial harvesting but also by spatial configuration of the residual trees. We identified several model functions that are likely responsible for divergences between empirical conditions and those simulated by SORTIE-ND for the boreal mixedwood and suggest specific empirical studies to improve parameter functions of this modelling tool.},

abstract = {1. Mast seeding is the synchronous and highly variable production of seed by a population of plants. Mast seeding results from the behaviour of individuals; however, little is known about the synchrony of individuals at local scales. 2. We address two primary questions at a within-population (17-36 ha study plots) and individual level: (i) How variable is seed production between and within years? (ii) How synchronized is seed production between individuals? 3. We monitored annual cone production of 356 Picea glauca (white spruce) from 1990 to 2005 within four plots spanning a total distance of 5.3 km in the Yukon Territory, Canada. 4. Spearman correlations (rs) were conducted to test for synchrony. Overall, the trees were moderately synchronous (mean rs (± SE) of 0.52 ± 0.14), and synchrony was statistically detectable (rs {\textgreater} 0) over all distances. Individuals {\textless} 75 m apart were highly synchronous (0.64 ± 0.18), and correlations dropped to 0.33 ± 0.07 for trees {\textgreater} 3 km apart. There was considerable variation in cone production patterns among pairs of individuals. 5. The number of mast years per plot varied from one to three. During a mast year, many individuals within plots produced large cone crops, with more variability between individuals in low mean cone years. Individual trees had dominant endogenous cycles varying from none to 1-5 years. Forty-four per cent of trees had no significant lag, 23{\%} a negative 1-year lag, and 20{\%} a positive 3-year lag. Basal area did not influence lags, but trees with higher mean cone production throughout the study were more likely to have a 3-year lag compared with no lag. 6. The scale of highest synchrony coincided with the scale at which the dominant seed predator in the area, the territorial red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), operates. This may be the scale at which selection for synchrony occurs. 7. Based on high synchrony locally, high synchrony within a mast year, and multiple lags in cone production by individuals, both available resources and strong weather cues appear to play roles in the observed patterns. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {Treeline ecotones are regarded as sensitive monitors of the recent climatic warming. However, it has been suggested that their sensitivity depends more on changes in tree density than on treeline position. We study these processes and the effect of climate, mainly air temperature, on tree recruitment and recent treeline dynamics. We selected three relatively undisturbed sites in the Spanish Pyrenees, dominated by Pinusuncinata, and analyzed their recent dynamics at local spatial (0.3–0.5 ha) and short temporal scales (100–300 years). We wanted to establish whether higher temperature was the only climatic factor causing an upward shift of the studied alpine treelines. The data we report show that treelines were ascending until a period of high interannual variability in mean temperature started (1950–95). During the late twentieth century, treeline fluctuation was less sensitive to climate than was the change in tree density within the ecotone. Tree recruitment and treeline position responded to contrasting climatic signals; tree recruitment was favored by high March temperatures whereas treeline position ascended in response to warm springs. We found a negative relationship between mean treeline-advance rate and March temperature variability. According to our findings, if the interannual variability of March temperature increases, the probability of successful treeline ascent will decrease.},

This article offers a brief review of the current state of biological treeline theory, and then explores the significance of tallness from a carbon balance, freezing resistance, and microclimatological perspective. It will be argued that having of a woody stem is neither a burden to the carbon balance nor does it add to the risk of freezing damage. The physiological means of trees to thrive in cold climates are similar to small stature plants, but due to their size, and, thus, closer aerodynamic coupling to air circulation, trees experience critically low temperatures at lower elevation and latitude than smaller plants. Hence, trees reach a limit at treeline for physical reasons related to their stature. Copyright {\textcopyright} Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2012.},

abstract = {Forests strongly affect Earth's carbon cycles, making our ability to forecast forest-productivity changes associated with rising temperatures and changes in precipitation increasingly critical. In this study, we model the influence of climate on annual radial growth using lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees grown for 34 years in a large provenance experiment in western Canada. We use a random-coefficient modeling approach to build universal growth-trend response functions that simultaneously incorporate the impacts of different provenance and site climates on radial growth trends under present and future annual (growth-year), summer, and winter climate regimes. This approach provides new depth to traditional quantitative genetics population response functions by illustrating potential changes in population dominance over time, as well as indicating the age and size at which annual growth begins declining for any population growing in any location under any present or future climate scenario within reason, given the ages and climatic conditions sampled. Our models indicate that lodgepole pine radial-growth levels maximize between 3.9° and 5.1° mean growth-year temperature. This translates to productivity declining by the mid-21st century in southern and central British Columbia (BC), while increasing beyond the 2080s in northern BC and Yukon, as temperatures rise. Relative to summer climate indices, productivity is predicted to decline continuously through the 2080s in all locations, while relative to winter climate variables, the opposite trend occurs, with the growth increases caused by warmer winters potentially offsetting the summer losses. Trees from warmer provenances, i.e., from the center of the species range, perform best in nearly all of our present and future climate-scenario models. We recommend that similar models be used to analyze population growth trends relative to annual and intra-annual climate in other large-scale provenance trials worldwide. An open-access growth-trend data set encompassing numerous biomes, species, and provenances would contribute substantially to predicting forest productivity under future-climate scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Recent world-wide episodes of tree dieback have been attributed to increasing temperatures and associated drought. Because these events are likely to become more common, improved knowledge of their cumulative effects on resilience and the ability to recover pre-disturbance conditions is important for forest management. Here we propose several indices to examine components of individual tree resilience based on tree ring growth: resistance (inverse of growth reduction during the episode), recovery (growth increase relative to the minimum growth during the episode), resilience (capacity to reach pre-episode growth levels) and relative resilience (resilience weighted by the damage incurred during the episode). Based on tree ring analyses, we analyzed historical patterns of tree resilience to successive drought-induced low growth periods in ponderosa pine trees growing in unmanaged, remote forests of the Rocky Mountains. Low-growth periods registered in tree rings were related to anomalies in the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and were attributed to drought. Independently of the impact of a specific event, subsequent growth after a single low-growth episode was related to the growth prior to the event. Growth performance differed with tree age: young trees were overall more resistant to low-growth periods, but older trees recovered better from more recent events. Regardless of tree age, recently burned sites exhibited lower post-episode growth and lower resistance and resilience than unburned ones. We found mixed evidence for the cumulative effect of past low-growth episodes: overall, greater impacts of a prior event and greater cumulative effects of past low-growth periods caused a decrease in resistance. However, we did not find a progressive decrease in resilience over time in old trees. Our results highlight the value of using a combination of estimators to evaluate the different components of resilience. Specifically, while tree responses to disturbance depend on past disturbance episodes, the response is context-specific and depends on the impact the capacity to recover after disturbance. This suggests that recent increases in forest mortality under current climate trends could relate to thresholds on specific components of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience itself) rather than to an overall loss of resilience over time. Identifying such thresholds and their underlying mechanisms is a promising area of research with important implications for forest management.},

abstract = {We developed a basal area growth model for recovery of advance growth of Norway spruce trees after clear-cutting. Stem diameter growth at ground level and needle-mass characteristics were measured on permanent sample plots in Estonia. Both tree ring analysis (destructive sampling on one sample plot) and yearly repeated measurement data (two plots) were used to quantify advance growth. Basal area growth of small trees was estimated by multiple regression analysis. Previous year basal area of the tree and basal area growth explained tree performance the next year. Tree needle-mass variables characterizing the acclimation status of the tree were included in the model as explanatory factors. Needle samples (one shoot from the upper third of each tree crown) were collected each year after the growth period from all sample trees. Needle masses of shoots from consecutive years were correlated and this variable was used as a predictor in the simulation model. Accelerating growth was observed in trees that exceeded the growth threshold in the year after release: the greater the needle mass per shoot, the greater the acceleration in growth. Competition among advance regeneration trees was included in the model: small trees under taller neighbors exhibited reduced growth. We found that trees released from a long period of heavy shade can survive, but the time needed for acclimation and resumption of competitive growth rates is considerably longer than for trees released from light shade. Such trees can be used for forest regeneration, but competition control (particularly reducing the proportion of fast-growing hardwoods) is required.},

abstract = {The estimation of aboveground biomass density (organic dry mass per unit area) is required for balancing Canadian national forest carbon budgets. Tree biomass equations are the basic tool for converting inventory plot data into biomass density. New sets of national tree biomass equations have therefore been produced from archival biomass data collected at the beginning of the 1980s through the ENergy from the FORest research program (ENFOR) of the Canadian Forest Service. Since the sampling plan was not standardized among provinces and territories, data had to be harmonized before any biomass equation could be considered at the national level. Two features characterize the new equations: estimated biomass of the compartments (foliage, branch, wood, and bark) are constrained to equal the total biomass, and dependence among error terms for the considered compartments of the same tree is taken into account in the estimates of both the model parameters and the variance prediction. The estimation method known to economists as “seemingly unrelated regression” allowed the inclusion of dependencies among the error terms of the considered biomass compartments. Sets of equations based on diameter at breast height (dbh) and on dbh and height have been produced for 33 species, groups of hardwood and softwood, and for all species combined. Biomass predicted by the new equa- tions was compared with that estimated from provincial equations to evaluate the loss of accuracy when scaling up from the regional to the national scale. Bias and error of prediction from the set of national equations based on dbh and height were generally more similar to those from provincial equations than to those of predictions from the set of equations based on dbh alone.},

Allen et al.-2010. A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests Forest Ecology and Management 259 (4) 660-684, ABSTRACT Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of 'variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

Stem diameter growth at ground level and needle-mass characteristics were measured on permanent sample plots in Estonia. Both tree ring analysis (destructive sampling on one sample plot) and yearly repeated measurement data (two plots) were used to quantify advance growth. Basal area growth of small trees was estimated by multiple regression analysis. Previous year basal area of the tree and basal area growth explained tree performance the next year. Tree needle-mass variables characterizing the acclimation status of the tree were included in the model as explanatory factors. Needle samples (one shoot from the upper third of each tree crown) were collected each year after the growth period from all sample trees. Needle masses of shoots from consecutive years were correlated and this variable was used as a predictor in the simulation model. Accelerating growth was observed in trees that exceeded the growth threshold in the year after release: the greater the needle mass per shoot, the greater the acceleration in growth.

abstract = {Questions: Did the forest area in the Swiss Alps increase between 1985 and 1997? Does the forest expansion near the tree line represent an invasion into abandoned grasslands (ingrowth) or a true upward shift of the local tree line? What land cover / land use classes did primarily regenerate to forest, and what forest structural types did primarily regenerate? And, what are possible drivers of forest regeneration in the tree line ecotone, climate and/or land use change? Location: Swiss Alps. Methods: Forest expansion was quantified using data from the repeated Swiss land use statistics GEOSTAT. A moving window algorithm was developed to distinguish between forest ingrowth and upward shift. To test a possible climate change influence, the resulting upward shifts were compared to a potential regional tree line. Results: A significant increase of forest cover was found between 1650 m and 2450 m. Above 1650 m, 10{\%} of the new forest areas were identified as true upward shifts whereas 90{\%} represented ingrowth, and we identified both land use and climate change as likely drivers. Most upward shift activities were found to occur within a band of 300 m below the potential regional tree line, indicating land use as the most likely driver. Only 4{\%} of the upward shifts were identified to rise above the potential regional tree line, thus indicating climate change. Conclusions: Land abandonment was the most dominant driver for the establishment of new forest areas, even at the tree line ecotone. However, a small fraction of upwards shift can be attributed to the recent climate warming, a fraction that is likely to increase further if climate continues to warm, and with a longer time-span between warming and measurement of forest cover.},

abstract = {Aim Treelines occur globally within a narrow range of mean growing season temperatures, suggesting that low-temperature growth limitation determines the position of the treeline. However, treelines also exhibit features that indicate that other mechanisms, such as biomass loss not resulting in mortality (dieback) and mortality, determine treeline position and dynamics. Debate regarding the mecha- nisms controlling treeline position and dynamicsmay be resolved by identifying the mechanisms controlling prominent treeline spatial patterns (or ‘form') such as the spatial structure of the transition fromclosed forest to the tree limit.Recent treeline studies world-wide have confirmed a close link between form and dynamics. Location The concepts presented refer to alpine treelines globally. Methods In this review, we describe how varying dominance of three general ‘first-level' mechanisms (tree performance: growth limitation, seedling mortality and dieback) result in different treeline forms, what ‘second-level' mechanisms (stresses, e.g. freezing damage, photoinhibition) may underlie these generalmecha- nisms, and how they are modulated by interactions with neighbours (‘third-level' mechanisms). This hierarchy of mechanisms should facilitate discussions about treeline formation and dynamics. Results We distinguish four primary treeline forms: diffuse, abrupt, island and krummholz.Growth limitation is dominant only at the diffuse treeline, which is the form that has most frequently responded as expected to growing-season warming, whereas the other forms are controlled by dieback and seedling mortality and are relatively unresponsive. Main conclusions Treeline form provides a means for explaining the current variability in treeline position and dynamics and for exploring the general mecha- nisms controlling the responses of treelines to climatic change. Form indicates the relative dependence of tree performance on various aspects of the external climate (especially summer warmth versuswinter stressors) and on internal feedbacks, thus allowing inferences on the type as well as strength of climate-change responses},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Franco, n = 40) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. {\&} C. Laws., n = 13) in the southern Canadian Cordillera. Relationships between the chronologies and monthly, seasonal, and annualized climatic parameters (precipitation, temperature, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)) were investigated using correlation analyses. The results indicate that tree growth at the sites is most strongly related to water availability during the growing season months. Although the response of the two species is similar, Douglas-fir show a slightly stronger correlation with seasonalized precipitation for the prior year and early summer whereas ponderosa pine correlate most strongly with current year and late (July) summer precipitation. Maximum correlations for both species occur with annual precipitation totals. The precipitation signal is slightly weaker in the more northerly Douglas-fir chronologies in British Columbia and the higher elevation sites in southwestern Alberta. Correlations with available PDSI records are generally comparable with those from precipitation variables, but the limited number of PDSI records and the availability of more proximal and better correlated precipitation records indicated that annual (summer-summer) precipitation totals provide the best possibilities to develop regional, moisture-related proxy climate records from these data. Analysis of earlywood and latewood chronologies for 28 sites (mainly Douglas-fir) indicates that earlywood width is most consistently and strongly correlated with precipitation in the previous summer (July and August), and latewood width is more strongly related to precipitation in the current summer (June and July). The results of these analyses demonstrate considerable potential for reconstructing annual (and (or) summer) precipitation for sites across the region.},

abstract = {The dynamics of forest ecosystems worldwide have been driven largely by climatic teleconnections. El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the strongest interannual variation of the Earth's climate, affecting the regional climatic regime. These teleconnections may impact plant phenology, growth rate, forest extent, and other gradual changes in forest ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate how Pinus cooperi populations face the influence of ENSO and regional microclimates in five ecozones in northwestern Mexico. Using standard dendrochronological techniques, tree-ring chronologies (TRI) were generated. TRI, ENSO, and climate relationships were correlated from 1950–2010. Additionally, multiple regressions were conducted in order to detect those ENSO months with direct relations in TRI (p {\textless} 0.1). The five chronologies showed similar trends during the period they overlapped, indicating that the P. cooperi populations shared an interannual growth variation. In general, ENSO index showed correspondences with tree-ring growth in synchronous periods. We concluded that ENSO had connectivity with regional climate in northern Mexico and radial growth of P. cooperi populations has been driven largely by positive ENSO values (El Ni{\~{n}}o episodes).},

abstract = {Competition is a well-documented contributor to tree mortality in temperate forests, with numerous studies documenting a relationship between tree death and the competitive environment. Models frequently rely on competition as the only non-random mechanism affecting tree mortality. However, for mature forests, competition may cease to be the primary driver of mortality.We use a large, long-term dataset to study the importance of competition in determining tree mortality in old-growth forests on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada of California, U.S.A. We make use of the comparative spatial configuration of dead and live trees, changes in tree spatial pattern through time, and field assessments of contributors to an individual tree's death to quantify competitive effects.Competition was apparently a significant contributor to tree mortality in these forests. Trees that died tended to be in more competitive environments than trees that survived, and suppression frequently appeared as a factor contributing to mortality. On the other hand, based on spatial pattern analyses, only three of 14 plots demonstrated compelling evidence that competition was dominating mortality. Most of the rest of the plots fell within the expectation for random mortality, and three fit neither the random nor the competition model. These results suggest that while competition is often playing a significant role in tree mortality processes in these forests it only infrequently governs those processes. In addition, the field assessments indicated a substantial presence of biotic mortality agents in trees that died.While competition is almost certainly important, demographics in these forests cannot accurately be characterized without a better grasp of other mortality processes. In particular, we likely need a better understanding of biotic agents and their interactions with one another and with competition. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Monitoring changes in vegetation at high-latitude and alpine treeline ecotones is critical for characterizing changes to carbon and energy budgets, plant species richness, and habitat suitability and is often considered a bellwether of a changing climate. Herein, we used transects of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to identify alpine treeline ecotones in the Yukon Territory of Canada, and assessed changes in vegetation greenness using a time-series of Landsat imagery over a 30 year period from 1985 to 2015. Specifically, we calculated the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from annual Landsat composites and assessed temporal trends within 500 m of detected forest-lines (i.e., transition point from continuous forest into treeline ecotones) using Theil-Sen's nonparametric regression. Across 74 detected treeline ecotones, 27.5{\%} of Landsat pixels displayed a significant positive trend in EVI and 5.6{\%} of pixels displayed a significant negative trend (p {\textless} 0.05). By using ALS data to determine vegetation structural class, we found that non-treed pixels had the highest percentage of significant positive trends in vegetation greenness (40.8{\%}), followed by shrubs (30.5{\%}), with lower percentages in sparse forests (18.9{\%}) and open/dense forests (13.3{\%}). These results suggest herbaceous and shrub vegetation types are undergoing the most significant changes in greenness, likely due to increases in shrub cover and herbaceous biomass in areas associated with these alpine treeline ecotones. The limited increases in EVI in forests likely indicates that vegetation cover is changing less rapidly in forests than in shrub and herbaceous vegetation types. Moreover, EVI may not be capturing increased height growth in forests near the treeline. Combining ALS data and Landsat time-series data provides a useful approach to locate and characterize alpine treeline ecotones, and enables the direct assessment of which vegetation structural classes are experiencing the greatest greening trends, thereby providing new insights to ecosystem change.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. The effects of climate change on tree growth in ecosystems limited by cold temperature remain unclear. In some cases, growth may increase, but because warmer temperatures can increase water stress, growth may also decline. As climate changes in the sub-boreal spruce (SBS) zone in central British Columbia, hybrid white spruce (Picea engelmannii × glauca)—a dominant but drought-intolerant species of this region—is predicted to decline over much of its range, while species such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) are likely to replace spruce. To see whether these shifts are already evident, we examined recent trends in basal area increment (BAI) of these two species over the past 50 yr (1961–2010) and explored relationships with climate variables in the SBS zone across a range of sites varying in water availability due to differences in climate and soil moisture regimes. In addition, we analyzed wood $\delta$13C during this period and root carbohydrate reserve (NSC) concentrations at the end of this period as indicators of water and carbon stress, respectively, to help interpret growth trends and climate relationships among sites. Spruce BAI was negatively associated with spring and/or summer temperature on all sites, but growth was never negatively correlated with temperature in Douglas-fir. For both species, lower BAI on the driest site was accompanied by higher $\delta$13C and lower root NSC reserve concentrations, particularly starch, consistent with drought stress reducing water and carbon availability for growth. However, there was no indication that the negative growth response to temperature was more pronounced on drier sites, as the only growth decline in spruce occurred on a mesic site with lower $\delta$13C. We conclude that rising temperatures are likely to negatively impact the growth of spruce more than Douglas-fir in the SBS zone, supporting predictions that spruce will decline and be replaced by other species like Douglas-fir. And while rising temperatures may have already reduced growth on some sites, these declines are not clearly related to increasing drought stress but may relate to effects on the timing of snowmelt.},

abstract = {In a global warming scenario, drought and heat waves like the one that occurred in 2003 in Europe are expected to become more intense and frequent. This extreme climate event strongly affected the hydraulic balance in many forest tree species including Douglas-fir, with symptoms ranging from partial crown necrosis to death. We studied a French Douglas-fir provenance trial, strongly affected by the 2003 drought and heat wave. Using wood X-ray microdensity profiles as a record of cambium response to environmental variations, we compared mean stem density and growth between dead and alive neighbouring trees and several microdensity characters measured over 17 growth rings previous to 2003. Special attention has been given to the sampling layout in order to minimize the micro-environmental effects. At tree level, surviving trees have a significantly higher mean stem density. At tree ring level, they have a significantly higher mean ring density, maximum ring density, latewood density and, to a lesser extent, latewood proportion. No significant difference was found for diameter growth. These results could have direct implications in the way to study and predict possible acclimation and adaptation of forest trees to climate change process. Wood could be used for the selection of genotypes with a desirable plasticity and resistance to drought induced-cavitation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Accounting for water stress-induced tree mortality in forest productivity models remains a challenge due to uncertainty in stress tolerance of tree populations. In this study, logistic regression models were developed to assess species-specific relationships between probability of mortality (Pm) and drought, drawing on 8.1 million observations of change in vital status (m) of individual trees across North America. Drought was defined by standardized (relative) values of soil water content (Ws,z) and reference evapotranspiration (ETr,z) at each field plot. The models additionally tested for interactions between the water-balance variables, aridity class of the site (AC), and estimated tree height (h). Considering drought improved model performance in 95 (80) per cent of the 64 tested species during calibration (cross-validation). On average, sensitivity to relative drought increased with site AC (i.e. aridity). Interaction between water-balance variables and estimated tree height indicated that drought sensitivity commonly decreased during early height development and increased during late height development, which may reflect expansion of the root system and decreasing whole-plant, leaf-specific hydraulic conductance, respectively. Across North America, predictions suggested that changes in the water balance caused mortality to increase from 1.1{\%} yr−1 in 1951 to 2.0{\%} yr−1 in 2014 (a net change of 0.9 ± 0.3{\%} yr−1). Interannual variation in mortality also increased, driven by increasingly severe droughts in 1988, 1998, 2006, 2007 and 2012. With strong confidence, this study indicates that water stress is a common cause of tree mortality. With weak-to-moderate confidence, this study strengthens previous claims attributing positive trends in mortality to increasing levels of water stress. This ‘learn-as-we-go' approach – defined by sampling rare drought events as they continue to intensify – will help to constrain the hydraulic limits of dominant tree species and the viability of boreal and temperate forest biomes under continued climate change.},

Studies that examine historical species responses over large geographic and climatic distances may provide insights into the temporal and spatial complexities underlying forest vulnerabil-ities to climate change. We analyzed annual tree-ring data collected from 56 white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) populations across the species' distribution in Yukon, Canada. Regional growth patterns were identified and correlation and response functions were computed to determine primary climatic influences on growth within each region. The temporal stability of climate–growth relationships was also tested in regions with sufficient climate records. Key results showed that white spruce radial growth shows strong geographic patterns across Yukon, likely reflecting large-scale climatic influences on growth. Drought appears to be a primary limitation to white spruce growth across much of southern Yukon, whereas snowfall and summer temperatures may be more important limitations in other regions. Spruce populations growing at high-elevations in central Yukon may be changing their climatic sensitiv-ity over time and are converging with low-elevation populations in terms of climate–growth relation-ships. The considerable spatial and temporal complexity of climate–growth responses suggest that climate change will have varying implications for white spruce growth across Yukon.},

abstract = {This study presents a second generation of homogenized monthly mean surface air temperature data set for Canadian climate trend analysis. Monthly means of daily maximum and of daily minimum temperatures were examined at 338 Canadian locations. Data from co-located observing sites were sometimes combined to create longer time series for use in trend analysis. Time series of observations were then adjusted to account for nation-wide change in observing time in July 1961, affecting daily minimum temperatures recorded at 120 synoptic stations; these were adjusted using hourly temperatures at the same sites. Next, homogeneity testing was performed to detect and adjust for other discontinuities. Two techniques were used to detect non-climatic shifts in de-seasonalized monthly mean temperatures: a multiple linear regression based test and a penalized maximal t test. These discontinuities were adjusted using a recently developed quantile-matching algorithm: the adjustments were estimated with the use of a reference series. Based on this new homogenized temperature data set, annual and seasonal temperature trends were estimated for Canada for 1950-2010 and Southern Canada for 1900-2010. Overall, temperature has increased at most locations. For 1950-2010, the annual mean temperature averaged over the country shows a positive trend of 1.5°C for the past 61 years. This warming is slightly more pronounced in the minimum temperature than in the maximum temperature; seasonally, the greatest warming occurs in winter and spring. The results are similar for Southern Canada although the warming is considerably greater in the minimum temperature compared to the maximum temperature over the period 1900-2010.},

abstract = {Alpine treelines are expected to advance to higher elevations in conjunction with global warming. Nevertheless, the importance of treeline reproductive patterns and seed dispersal within the alpine treeline ecotone remains unresolved. In this study, we address two research questions at mountain hemlock treelines on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska: (1) What is the primary mode of reproduction and (2) are seeds leading to recruitment derived from within the local treeline populations or are they arriving from more distant seed sources? To answer these questions, we exhaustively sampled mountain hemlock individuals along a single mountain slope, and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. First, we assessed mode of reproduction by determining the proportion of sampled individuals with identical multilocus genotypes that are the product of clonal reproduction. Second, we used a categorical parentage analysis to identify parent–offspring pairs, so that the proportion of treeline reproduction events could be spatially quantified and dispersal distance measured. We identified sexual reproduction as the primary mode of reproduction at our study site. Seedling establishment was characterized by extensive seed immigration and gene flow into the ecotone. The average dispersal distance was 73 m with long-distance dispersal identified as dispersal occurring at distances greater than 450 m. We found that production of seeds within the alpine treeline ecotone is not necessarily a requirement for treelines to advance to higher elevations in response to climate change. The extensive seed dispersal and gene flow into the alpine treeline ecotone is likely sufficient to propel the ecotone higher under more favorable climate.},

abstract = {Aim: Most studies focusing on the alpine tree line responses to climate warming have used either the tree densification within the ecotone or its elevational upshift as indicators. However, it is acknowledged that the relationship between densification and upshift is spatially heterogeneous, making inferences and comparability among studies tricky. The lack of consistent empirical evidence on this potential mismatch and its drivers leads us to focus on this issue in this study. The aim was twofold: (a) to quantify the mismatch between the two processes at a regional scale, and (b) to identify its site-specific determinants. Taxon: Pinus uncinata (Ramond ex DC.). Location: French eastern Pyrenees. Methods: An object-oriented supervised classification procedure was performed on historical (1953) and current (2015) aerial photographs. Based on the resulting rasters, densification of the tree line ecotone and upward shift of the tree line were estimated at the two dates in 191 sites, then standardized, before finally being compared. Three site clusters were derived (no mismatch, densification prevalence and upshift prevalence). After having characterized their spatial patterns through join count statistics, a multinomial logistic regression model was computed to identify the correlates of these clusters among a list of site variables. Results: No spatial pattern among the categories of responses emerges at a local scale, but buffers with no mismatch tend to aggregate at a larger scale. Changes in minimum air temperatures, site elevation, mean slope, slope morphometry and lithology appear as significant drivers of the observed mismatch, implying that the relationship between densification and elevational upshift is context specific. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that both densification and upshift should be considered in quantitative analyses of tree line spatial dynamics, since these two ecological processes are not controlled by the same drivers.},

The two other sites each contain two subpopulations showing varying growth responses. One subpopulation diverges from historical temperature data after 1950 and one shows increased growth consistent with warming or exceeds expected growth increases. The growth decline may be due to temperature-induced drought stress that acts on some trees.

abstract = {Abstract A central challenge in global change research is the projection of the future behavior of a system based upon past observations. Tree-ring data have been used increasingly over the last decade to project tree growth and forest ecosystem vulnerability under future climate conditions. But how can the response of tree growth to past climate variation predict the future, when the future does not look like the past? Space-for-time substitution (SFTS) is one way to overcome the problem of extrapolation: the response at a given location in a warmer future is assumed to follow the response at a warmer location today. Here we evaluated an SFTS approach to projecting future growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), a species that occupies an exceptionally large environmental space in North America. We fit a hierarchical mixed-effects model to capture ring-width variability in response to spatial and temporal variation in climate. We found opposing gradients for productivity and climate sensitivity with highest growth rates and weakest response to interannual climate variation in the mesic coastal part of Douglas-fir?s range; narrower rings and stronger climate sensitivity occurred across the semi-arid interior. Ring-width response to spatial vs. temporal temperature variation was opposite in sign, suggesting that spatial variation in productivity, caused by local adaptation and other slow processes, cannot be used to anticipate changes in productivity caused by rapid climate change. We thus substituted only climate sensitivities when projecting future tree growth. Growth declines were projected across much of Douglas-fir?s distribution, with largest relative decreases in the semiarid U.S. Interior West and smallest in the mesic Pacific Northwest. We further highlight the strengths of mixed-effects modeling for reviving a conceptual cornerstone of dendroecology, Cook?s 1987 aggregate growth model, and the great potential to use tree-ring networks and results as a calibration target for next-generation vegetation models.},

abstract = {This paper integrates dendrochronological, demographic, and experimental perspectives to improve understanding of the response of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) tree growth to climatic variability in interior Alaska. The dendrochronological analyses indicate that climate warming has led to widespread declines in white spruce growth throughout interior Alaska that have become more prevalent during the 20th century. Similarly, demographic studies show that white spruce tree growth is substantially limited by soil moisture availability in both mid- and late-successional stands. Interannual variability in tree growth among stands within a landscape exhibits greater synchrony than does growth of trees that occupy different landscapes, which agrees with dendrochronological findings that the responses depend on landscape position and prevailing climate. In contrast, the results from 18 years of a summer moisture limitation experiment showed that growth in midsuccessional upland stands was unaffected by moisture limitation and that moisture limitation decreased white spruce growth in floodplain stands where it was expected that growth would be less vulnerable because of tree access to river water. Taken together, the evidence from the different perspectives analyzed in this study clearly indicates that white spruce tree growth in interior Alaska is vulnerable to the effects of warming on plant water balance.},

abstract = {A few tree ring studies indicate recent growth declines at northern latitudes. The precise causes are not well understood. Here we identify a temperature threshold for decline in a tree ring record from a well-established temperature-sensitive site at elevational tree line in northwestern Canada. The positive ring width/temperature relationship has weakened such that a pre-1965 linear model systematically overpredicts tree ring widths from 1965 to 1999. A nonlinear model shows an inverted U-shaped relationship between this chronology and summer temperatures, with an optimal July-August average temperature of 11.3°C based on a nearby station. This optimal value has been consistently exceeded since the 1960s, and the concurrent decline demonstrates that even at tree line, trees can be negatively affected when temperatures warm beyond a physiological threshold. If warming continues without significant gains in effective precipitation, the large-scale greening of recent decades could be replaced by large-scale browning. Such browning could slow or reverse carbon uptake by northern forests. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

BC Journal of Ecosystems and Management 10(3):49–64. www.forrex.org/publications/jem/ISS52/vol10{\_}no3{\_}art7.pdf Published by Forrex Forum for research and extension in Natural resources Abstract The biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification (BEC) method for distinguishing areas of reasonably homogeneous macroclimate has been used in British Columbia for over 20 years. Because of the paucity of actual long-term climate data, the method used other means to map climate. We tested how well the BEC climate units could be discriminated from one another using spatially modelled climate data. We tested the ability of climate data to distinguish three units for each of four climatically different zones at two levels of the climatic classification using discriminant analysis. For each analysis, 60 points were randomly selected from within the boundaries of the mapped unit and climate data were generated by ClimateBC. Even at the finest level of the mapping, over 70{\%} of the randomly selected points were correctly classified according to the mapped unit based on selected climate variables. A large proportion of the misclassified points were within 1 km horizontal distance or 100 m elevation of the boundary and are typically climatically transitional areas. We recommend that the BEC climate unit should form the basic unit for examining climate change at multiple scales from the provincial scale to the scale of watersheds or basins, and that further analysis be conducted to both improve biogeoclimatic unit mapping and climate models.},

@article{Thorpe2007,
abstract = {In the past 10 to 15 years, alternative silvicultural treatments involving partial harvesting have been developed for boreal forests, with the goal of achieving a balance between biodiversity maintenance and continued timber production. Most prior research has focussed on the impacts of partial harvesting on biological diversity, while stand dynamic responses remain little studied. In this paper we explore partial stand harvesting in the Canadian boreal - its rationale, current extent, and impact on stand dynamic patterns. Empirical studies from the boreal and elsewhere indicate that residual trees of many species respond to partial harvesting with enhanced growth, commonly showing a lagged response after which peak growth occurs five to 25 years following harvest. Post-harvest mortality is also prevalent but much more variable, with losses of residual trees ranging from nearly zero to more than 50{\%} above background mortality rates in the initial years following harvest. With the exception of strip cutting in parts of northern Ontario and Quebec (HARP/CPPTM), operational partial harvesting in the Canadian boreal currently involves very low levels of retention. Available data suggest that such low retention levels, particularly when spatially dispersed, generally result in unacceptably high rates of post-harvest mortality, which are unlikely to be offset by increases in residual tree growth. There is an urgent need for development of spatially explicit stand simulation models that will allow accurate yield predictions for partial harvest systems to assess their feasibility in boreal forest management.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society of American Foresters. In 1950, the US Forest Service initiated a cutting practice level (CPL) study on the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine on the basis of findings of a national appraisal of forestland management. Silvicultural treatments, including the selection system with 5- and 15-year cutting cycles, fixed diameter-limit cutting, and variants of commercial clearcutting, were chosen to represent "High-order," "Good," "Fair," and "Poor" cutting practices as then defined for eastern spruce-fir (Picea-Abies; northern conifer) forests. After 60 years, selection treatments have maintained a wide distribution of tree sizes, increased the proportion of mature spruce, and decreased the proportion of hardwoods; selection cutting on a 15-year cycle resulted in the highest current stand value. Fixed diameter-limit cutting resulted in the greatest harvest revenue but degraded residual stand composition, structure, and value. Outcomes of commercial clearcutting varied as a function of treatment (none, repeated harvest, or rehabilitation) after the first harvest. After 60 years, the proportion of acceptable growing stock was highest in selection and rehabilitation treatments and lowest in fixed diameter-limit and commercial clearcut treatments. Findings confirm that long-term outcomes of silvicultural treatments with attention to residual stand condition surpass those managed for short-term financial gains with regard to residual stand structure, value, and quality.},

abstract = {The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province's area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC's ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.},

The outbreak did not favor new seedling establishment of the seral lodgepole pine. Thus, in seral stands spruce beetle outbreak accelerates succession towards the shade-tolerant tree species. The predominant response to the outbreak was release of previously suppressed small-diameter spruce (not attacked by the beetle) and subalpine fir (a non-host species). Growth rates of released trees remained high for {\textgreater}40 yr. Both spruce and fir will continue to codominate the affected stands. -from Authors},

Solar radiation and air temperature are used to calculate net radiation. Interception is calculated from the daily rainfall. The root zone is treated as a single layer with drainage calculated as a function of the root zone water content. Water deficits and the matric potential of the root zone are used to indicate tree Water stress. The model was tested on two Douglas fir stands of different stand density and leaf area index.

Most trees face several drought events during their life and therefore resilience to dry conditions may be crucial to long-term survival. We assessed how growth resilience to severe droughts, including its components resistance and recovery, is related to the ability to survive future droughts by using a tree-ring database of surviving and now-dead trees from 118 sites (22 species, {\textgreater}3,500 trees). We found that, across the variety of regions and species sampled, trees that died during water shortages were less resilient to previous non-lethal droughts, relative to coexisting surviving trees of the same species. In angiosperms, drought-related mortality risk is associated with lower resistance (low capacity to reduce impact of the initial drought), while it is related to reduced recovery (low capacity to attain pre-drought growth rates) in gymnosperms. The different resilience strategies in these two taxonomic groups open new avenues to improve our understanding and prediction of drought-induced mortality.},

Nutt). The overstory was clear-cut (T0), thinned to 600 (T600) or to 1200 (T1200) stems/ha, or left uncut (control). Three years after release, understory responses were best demonstrated by decreasing specific leaf area with increasing release level and by changes to height and radial growth increments. Clear-cutting the overstory stalled the height growth in fir for two seasons and radial growth at the tree base for one season. Compared with the control, the 3-year height increment was proportionally greatest in intermediate trees of T600, and this treatment produced the overall best response in height growth. Complete birch removal produced the best radial growth response despite the initial growth check. However, no release treatment significantly affected the whole tree variables (aboveground biomass, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), live crown ratio) within the studied time frame. Shoot silhouette ratios were lowest in the completely released understory trees, while they were similar to those of the controls in all partial-release treatments. Tree sturdiness (height/DBH ratio) was 80-90 in most treatments except TO, where it declined to below 80. Despite this improvement, large trees in TO have been damaged by wind and snow.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come a vast amount of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.},

abstract = {Selecting the geographic origin-the provenance-of seed is a key decision in restoration. The last decade has seen a vigorous debate on whether to use local or nonlocal seed. The use of local seed has been the preferred approach because it is expected to maintain local adaptation and avoid deleterious population effects (e.g., maladaptation and outbreeding depression). However, the impacts of habitat fragmentation and climate change on plant populations have driven the debate on whether the local-is-best standard needs changing. This debate has largely been theoretical in nature, which hampers provenance decision-making. Here, we detail cross-sector priority actions to improve provenance decision-making, including embedding provenance trials into restoration projects; developing dynamic, evidence-based provenance policies; and establishing stronger research-practitioner collaborations to facilitate the adoption of research outcomes. We discuss how to tackle these priority actions in order to help satisfy the restoration sector's requirement for appropriately provenanced seed.},

abstract = {An experiment was established in 1991-1992 in northern British Columbia to investigate factors influencing natural regeneration rates of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) in three stand structures created by harvesting. Harvest treatments were a 32-ha clearcut, 0.2-ha patch cuts, and single-tree selection. Cone crop periodicity was independent of harvesting system. Natural seedfall was higher in the selection treatment and small patch cut than the clearcut treatment every year. Five years after harvest, the selection and patch cut treatments had 7 times as many spruce germinants and 10 times as many subalpine fir germinants as the clearcut treatment. Seed availability appears to be the primary limiting factor for establishment of both subalpine fir and spruce in the clearcut treatment. For spruce establishment in the selection and small patch cut treatments, availability of both seed and mineral soil seedbeds were limiting factors, while for subalpine fir, germinant establishment appears primarily limited by availability of disturbed forest floor seedbeds. Foresters could increase opportunities for natural regeneration in these subalpine forests by (i) modifying harvest patterns to enhance conifer seed distribution over harvested areas and (ii) applying seedbed preparation treatments prior to anticipated heavy seedfalls.

abstract = {The determination of an optimal sequence of diameter distributions and selection harvests for uneven-aged stand management is formulated as a discrete-time optimal-control problem with bounded control variables and free-terminal point. An efficient programming technique utilizing gradients provides solutions that are stable and interpretable on the basis of economic principles. Methods and results are demonstrated using a whole-standdiameter-class simulator developed for northern hardwoods stands in Wisconsin. Examples in which the objective is present net worth maximization over a 150-year planning horizon with a 5-year cutting cycle suggest two types of optimal equilibrium stand structures: a downward-sloping diameter distribution if large value premiums are assigned to the largest diameter classes and a truncated diameter distribution if premiums for larger trees are gradual or absent. Transition strategies vary in length and harvest pattern depending on the stumpage value function used. It is emphasized that equilibrium management regimes developed with static analysis are not optimal when used as starting conditions in dynamic formulations. FOREST SCI. 3 1:45 1 4 6 2. ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS. Forest economics, optimal control theory, gradient projection method, nonlinear programming. THE INCORPORATION of even-aged stand growth and yield simulators into dynamic programming frameworks has improved the economic analysis of silvicultural investment decisions in stand-level even-aged management (Brodie and Kao 1979, Martin and Ek 198 1, Riitters and others 1982). Uneven-aged stand simulators cannot be readily incorporated into dynamic programming frameworks because the large number of decision variables involved would require long computation time and massive computer storage. We introduce a more efficient optimization technique based on optimal control theory and demonstrate its use in finding the optimal sequence of diameter distributions and selection harvests for an uneven-aged stand. The decision variables facing a forest manager interested in applying uneven-aged management at the stand level are (1) the cutting cycle length, and (2) the diameter distribution and species composition after each selection harvest during a given planning horizon. We use the optimization technique to solve the diameter distribution problem, and it can be expanded to analyze both cutting cycle length and species composition problems.},

abstract = {Conservation of forest-dwelling caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is of great concern across most of its range. Anthropogenic disturbances, primarily logging activities, have been identified as the most important cause of caribou decline, although the mechanisms underlying this decline are not fully understood. Caribou commonly display fidelity to calving sites or seasonal ranges, but the potential role of this life-history trait has been largely overlooked in research and conservation planning. This is surprising because sites and ranges with high inter-annual use should have high conservation value. We investigated the relationship between habitat disturbances and home-range fidelity of forest-dwelling caribou across three study sites in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, using a broad range of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Between 2004 and 2007, we tracked 47 adult female caribou using GPS collars. Home-range fidelity varied between seasons, being higher during calving and summer, and lower during winter. Caribou reduced fidelity following natural and anthropogenic disturbances, the latter having a stronger negative influence. Anthropogenic disturbances had a strong negative impact on home-range fidelity during annual, summer and winter periods, whereas natural disturbance was the dominant factor during calving. Despite this negative influence on fidelity, caribou tended to demonstrate range fidelity even in study sites most impacted by human activities. Habitat disturbances could produce two possible outcomes for caribou conservation: (1) a trend for females to reduce home-range fidelity which could translate into lower calf and female caribou survival through reduced familiarity with food distribution, escape cover and predation risk and (2) a global tendency to maintain range fidelity even in a drastically modified landscape which could turn into an ecological trap, particularly for calves when predation risk increases due to increased black bear density in early successional forests. Taking range fidelity behavior into consideration during forest management planning could direct conservation efforts toward the best available sites and therefore facilitate caribou persistence in managed landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study focused on tree mortality in spruce-dominated stands managed using the single-tree selection method in southern Finland. Together with regeneration and tree growth, mortality is one of the basic elements of the stand structure and dynamics in selection stands. The study was based on data acquired from a set of 20 permanent experimental plots monitored with repeated measurements for 20 years. The average mortality in the number of stems (N) was 4.45 trees ha−1a−1, in basal area (G) 0.07 m2 ha−1a−1, and in stemwood volume (V) 0.56 m3 ha−1a−1. In relative terms it was 0.50{\%} of N, 0.30{\%} of G and 0.27{\%} of V, respectively. Wind and snow were the most common causes of mortality, while deaths by biotic causes (mammals, insects, pathogens) were extremely rare. Some 6–10{\%} of the total loss in the number of stems and volume was attributable to the loss or removal of trees that sustained serious damage in harvesting. Most of the mortality occurred in the smallest diameter classes of up to 20 cm. Such a high mortality among small trees can have an adverse influence on the sustainability of selection structures if not successfully checked in harvesting and management.},

abstract = {The most widespread response to global warming among alpine treeline ecotones is not an upward shift, but an increase in tree density. However, the impact of increasing density on interactions among trees at treeline is not well understood. Here, we test if treeline densification induced by climatic warming leads to increasing intraspecific competition. We mapped and measured the size and age of Smith fir trees growing in two treelines located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. We used spatial point-pattern and codispersion analyses to describe the spatial association and covariation among seedlings, juveniles, and adults grouped in 30-yr age classes from the 1860s to the present. Effects of competition on tree height and regeneration were inferred from bivariate mark-correlations. Since the 1950s, a rapid densification occurred at both sites in response to climatic warming. Competition between adults and juveniles or seedlings at small scales intensified as density increased. Encroachment negatively affected height growth and further reduced recruitment around mature trees. We infer that tree recruitment at the studied treelines was more cold-limited prior to 1950 and shifted to a less temperature-constrained regime in response to climatic warming. Therefore, the ongoing densification and encroachment of alpine treelines could alter the way climate drives their transitions toward subalpine forests.},

abstract = {Severe droughts have caused widespread tree mortality across many forest biomes with profound effects on the function of ecosystems and carbon balance. Climate change is expected to intensify regional-scale droughts, focusing attention on the physiological basis of drought-induced tree mortality. Recent work has shown that catastrophic failure of the plant hydraulic system is a principal mechanism involved in extensive crown death and tree mortality during drought, but the multi-dimensional response of trees to desiccation is complex. Here we focus on the current understanding of tree hydraulic performance under drought, the identification of physiological thresholds that precipitate mortality and the mechanisms of recovery after drought. Building on this, we discuss the potential application of hydraulic thresholds to process-based models that predict mortality. F orests account for approximately 45{\%} of global terrestrial carbon stocks and have a key role in hydrological and nutrient cycles 1,2. They also provide a wide array of ecosystem services and are vital for maintenance of biodiversity. While forests continue to face pressure from expanding human populations, which drive changes in land use and deforestation, the threat posed by climate change is less easily quantified. Evidence from a range of sources suggests that rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have benefited forests, with CO 2 fertilization enabling an increased leaf area index 3 , enhanced water-use efficiency 4 and greater uptake of carbon globally 5. However, extreme climate events, such as heat waves, droughts, fires and storms, have the potential to offset these benefits, causing widespread tree mortality and a net loss of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Although forests are vulnerable to a wide range of extreme climate events, drought and associated disturbances have the greatest effect globally 6. Recent projections 7 indicate that land surface warming may lead to longer and more intense droughts, which has focused concern on this area of research and the need for accurate predictions of the effects of drought on forest ecosystems. In this Review, we examine the physiological response of trees to drought, focusing on new insights provided by rapid advances in our understanding of the hydraulic function of plants. Land plants require an efficient long-distance transport pathway to lift water from the soil to the leaves at a rate that satisfies transpira-tion 8. In trees, the xylem tissue (wood) supplies water for all aspects of plant function, including photosynthesis, growth and reproduction. Damage to this hydraulic supply network as a consequence of severe water stress has been identified as a key mechanism that is involved in tree mortality during drought 9-11. Recent experimental work has quantitatively linked hydraulic failure thresholds to plant mortality 12,13 , and field studies have demonstrated that hydraulic failure is a primary pathway for extensive canopy death or plant mortality during natural drought events 14-17. A number of other co-contributing factors may also have a role in the death of trees during natural droughts 18. In the absence of catastrophic hydraulic failure, partial disruption of water transport and the regulation of water loss from plants during drought may lead to an increased likelihood of mortality through the depletion of carbohydrate reserves used in respiration and increased vulnerability to pests and pathogens 11. Therefore, even in cases of co-morbidity, plant hydraulic traits occupy a central role in determining survival during drought and the effects of drought on carbon dynamics. Here, we cover recent progress in our understanding of plant hydraulic response to drought and the physiological mechanisms that govern recovery of hydraulic function after drought. Although recent advances have crystallized our understanding of plant hydraulic function and the consequences of vascular impairment caused by drought stress, many challenges remain. We evaluate recent attempts to integrate the hydraulic traits of plants into process-based models of tree mortality with an emphasis on major knowledge gaps.},

abstract = {In forests of the western United States, high levels of forest stocking attributed to fire exclusion and settlement-era logging practices have coincided with periods of extensive forest mortality associated with extreme drought and forest pest outbreaks. This has led to the widespread but largely untested generalization that increased stand density causes increased levels of forest mortality, even for uneven-aged, multi-species, mature stands that are not actively undergoing self-thinning. We used archival Landsat imagery to examine: (1) variations in forest mortality among forest types and climate periods from 1985 to 2010 in the mixed conifer forest of the Lake Tahoe Basin, (2) relationships between stand density and mortality in the subsequent year, and (3) the influence of environmental variables on forest mortality. We found that positive density dependent mortality, where increased stand density is associated with increased probability of mortality, is associated more with lower elevation forests and drier climate periods. In mid- to upper-elevation forests, increased density was more often associated with decreased probability of mortality, especially during wetter periods. Results showed highest tree mortality during a drought in the beginning of our 25-year time series, but not in a subsequent drought period of similar severity. Our study also found increased risk of tree mortality on north-facing slopes across all forests and all climate periods, even when stand density was controlled for. There is a nuanced relationship between stocking level, forest mortality and drought effects, suggesting that no single density-reduction forest management strategy will increase forest resilience under all climate periods and in all forest types.},

abstract = {Growth response of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) to climate was studied across its local geographical and elevation range in the Olympic Mountains, Washington. A dendroecological analysis of subalpine fir across a range of elevations (1350‐1850 m) and annual precipitation (125‐350 cm y−1), was used to compare environmental factors affecting growth. Climate‐growth relationships were explored using Pearson product‐moment correlation coefficients; partial correlation analysis was used to assess relationships among site chronologies and climatic variables. Radial growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation at high elevation and wet sites, but not at low and middle elevation dry sites. Growth is positively correlated with current growing season temperature at all sites; however, growth is negatively correlated with previous year August temperature, indicating that climate affects growth in subsequent years. Positive correlations between growth and summer precipitation during the growing season at low and middle elevation dry sites suggest that soil moisture is partially limiting to growth on these sites. If the climate of the Pacific Northwest becomes warmer and drier, then subalpine fir growth may increase at high elevation and wet sites, but may decrease at lower elevation dry sites in the Olympic Mountains. However, the growth response of subalpine fir to potentially rapid climate change will not be uniform because subalpine fir grows over a wide range of topographic features, habitats, and local climates at different geographical scales. A comparison of growth response to current growing season temperature suggests that the temperature‐related growth response of subalpine fir is not adequately described by the parabolic curve used in JABOWA‐based models.

abstract = {Stand and disturbance dynamics are key processes that need to be assessed along with climate-species interactions if we are to better understand the impacts of climate change on species. In this study we investigated the biotic interactions (competition) between species, the influence of disturbance type, and changes in resource availability (moisture and light) on the response of six tree species to climate change in the northwest region of central British Columbia, Canada. Two ecological models were parameterized, linked together and coupled to climate change scenarios to explore the interactions between: (1) the response of species in the regeneration phase and (2) the role of disturbance, resource availability and competition on determining stand composition and productivity. Climate change was found to reduce soil moisture availability which resulted in a decline in regeneration potential for all species on dry sites and negative to neutral responses on sites with higherwater availability. Following fire, stand dynamics and composition were modeled to undergo significant changes under the 2080s climate compared to current climate conditions on dry and mesic sites. Changes in stand dynamics under climate change were marginal following bark beetle disturbances. While significant changes to stand dynamics were found on dry sites, the presented results suggest that the sites with the highest moisture availability maintain the same general stand dynamics and composition following disturbances under climate change. This study highlights the need to consider species response to climate change in interaction with existing stand conditions, disturbance type, competition, resource availability, not just temperature and precipitation.},

abstract = {Tree rings have long been used to calibrate the net primary production (NPP) time-series predicted by process-based models, based on an implicit assumption that ring-width indices (RWI) can well reflect temporal NPP change. However, this assumption has seldom been tested systematically. In this study, 36 plots were set in three forest types from four sites along a latitudinal gradient in northeast China. For each plot, we constructed chronologies and stand NPP of the past 20 years to examine: is RWI a good proxy of inter-annual variation of forest NPP for different forest types under different climate? If it is, why? Our results indicate that RWI was closely related to stand NPP in most cases, and could be used as a good proxy of NPP in temperate forests. Standard and arstan chronologies were better related to NPP series than residual chronology. Stand NPP time-series were mainly determined by large trees, and the correlation between RWI and NPP was also higher for larger trees. We suggest that large trees and dominant species of canopy layer should be sampled for chronology construction. Large trees are major contributors of forest biomass and productivity, and should have priority in forest conservation in a rapid-warming world.},

abstract = {As the climate changes, drought may reduce tree productivity and survival across many forest ecosystems; however, the relative influence of specific climate parameters on forest decline is poorly understood. We derive a forest drought-stress index (FDSI) for the southwestern United States using a comprehensive tree-ring data set representing AD 1000-2007. The FDSI is approximately equally influenced by the warm-season vapour-pressure deficit (largely controlled by temperature) and cold-season precipitation, together explaining 82{\%} of the FDSI variability. Correspondence between the FDSI and measures of forest productivity, mortality, bark-beetle outbreak and wildfire validate the FDSI as a holistic forest-vigour indicator. If the vapour-pressure deficit continues increasing as projected by climate models, the mean forest drought-stress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1,000 years. Collectively, the results foreshadow twenty-first-century changes in forest structures and compositions, with transition of forests in the southwestern United States, and perhaps water-limited forests globally, towards distributions unfamiliar to modern civilization.

In central British Columbia, we studied the responses of three species (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss × Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm., and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and in northwestern Quebec, we studied one species (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Stem and root diameter and height growth were measured 5 years before and 3 years after harvesting. Both root and stem diameter growth increased sharply following release but seedlings showed greater root growth, suggesting that in the short term, improvement in soil resource capture and transport, and presumably stability, may be more important than an increase in stem diameter and height growth. Response was strongly size dependent, which appears to reflect greater demand for soil resources as well as higher light levels and greater tree vigour before release for taller individuals. Growth ratios could not explain the faster response generally attributed to true fir species or the unusual swift response of spruces. Good prerelease vigour of spruces, presumably favoured by deciduous canopies, could explain their rapid response to release.

Compact multispectral drone sensors capture high-resolution imagery in visible and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing for the calculation of vegetation indices, such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) for productivity estimates and vegetation classification. Despite the technological advances, challenges remain in capturing high-quality data, highlighting the need for standardized workflows. Here, we discuss challenges, technical aspects, and practical considerations of vegetation monitoring using multispectral drone sensors and propose a workflow based on remote sensing principles and our field experience in high-latitude environments, using the Parrot Sequoia (Pairs, France) sensor as an example. We focus on the key error sources associated with solar angle, weather conditions, geolocation, and radiometric calibration and estimate their relative contributions that can lead to uncertainty of more than ±10{\%} in peak season NDVI estimates of our tundra field site. Our findings show that these errors can be accounted for by improved flight planning, metadata collection, ground control point deployment, use of reflectance targets, and quality control. With standardized best practice, multispectral sensors can provide meaningful spatial data that is reproducible and comparable across space and time.},

abstract = {Fine-scale height-growth response of boreal trees to canopy openings is difficult to measure from the ground, and there are important limitations in using stereophotogrammetry in defining gaps and determining individual crowns and height. However, precise knowledge on height growth response to different openings is critical for refining partial harvesting techniques. In this study, we question whether conifers and hardwoods respond equally in terms of sapling growth or lateral growth to openings. We also ask to what distance gaps affect tree growth into the forest. We use multi-temporal lidar to characterize tree/sapling height and lateral growth responses over five years to canopy openings and high resolution images to identify conifers and hardwoods. Species-class-wise height-growth patterns of trees/saplings in various neighborhood contexts were determined across a 6-km2 matrix of Canadaian boreal mixed deciduous coniferous forests. We then use statistical techniques to probe how these growth responses vary by spatial location with respect to the gap edge. Results confirm that both mechanisms of gap closure contribute to the closing of canopies at a rate of 1.2{\%} per annum. Evidence also shows that both hardwood and conifer gap edge trees have a similar lateral growth (average of 22 cm/yr) and similar rates of height growth irrespective of their location and initial height. Height growth of all saplings, however, was strongly dependent on their position within the gap and the size of the gap. Results suggest that hardwood and softwood saplings in gaps have greatest growth rates at distances of 0.5-2 m and 1.5-4 m from the gap edge and in openings smaller than 800 m2 and 250 m2, respectively. Gap effects on the height growth of trees in the intact forest were evident up to 30 m and 20 m from gap edges for hardwood and softwood overstory trees, respectively. Our results thus suggest that foresters should consider silvicultural techniques that create many small openings in mixed coniferous deciduous boreal forests to maximize the growth response of both residual and regenerating trees. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Moisture availability is a key factor that influences white oak (Quercus alba L.) growth and wood production. In unglaciated eastern North America, available soil moisture varies greatly along topographic and edaphic gradients. This study was aimed at determining the effects of soil moisture variability and macroclimate on white oak growth in mixed-oak forests of southern Ohio. Using accurately dated and measured tree rings, we analyzed 119 white oaks growing across an integrated moisture index (IMI), a computer-generated GIS model that simultaneously combines topographic and edaphic features into a moisture index scale. Growth trends varied considerably across the IMI, with trees in mesic sites exhibiting patterns much different from those in either xeric or intermediate sites. BAI growth and biomass increments were higher for trees growing in the intermediate and mesic sites than those from the xeric sites. Correlation and response function analyses, and redundancy analysis revealed significant relations between ring-width indices and climate, with current year May-July PDSI, precipitation and temperature as the most important correlates of white oak growth. Additionally, climatic influences on growth rate were variable across the IMI; trees in xeric sites showed much greater coefficients relative to those from the intermediate and mesic sites. Despite these differences, xeric and intermediate trees exhibited similar growth patterns. The present results provide further evidence of the usefulness of the IMI for identifying and comparing white oak growth patterns across the complex, dissected landscape of southern Ohio.},

abstract = {Dendroecological techniques were used in this study to compare the radial growth patterns of different conifer species and to identify regional climatic anomalies and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) outbreaks for the past four centuries in the McGregor Model Forest, central British Columbia, Canada. Tree-ring chronologies of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii vat. glauca (Beissn.) Franco), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca (Moench) Voss) were developed for the Model Forest. Response function analysis showed that (1) Douglas-fir is the most climate sensitive species, and its radial growth is mainly controlled by spring precipitation and early summer temperature, and (2) the ring growth of subalpine fir and spruce is negatively affected by high summer temperature. Comparisons of the tree-ring chronologies among the three species revealed dynamics of growth releases and suppressions which reflected climate variations and forest disturbance patterns in the past several centuries. The climate during the late 1750s-1800s was characterized by slightly moist springs and probably moderate summers. During the late 1860s and early 1870s, the region experienced dry springs, hot summers, and probably cold late falls. This study identified three intervals of major disturbances attributable to severe spruce beetle outbreaks: the late 1720s, 1810s-1820s, and 1960s-early 1980s. These coincided with periods of above average growth in Douglas-fir. The association suggested a possible moist spring-outbreak pattern. The multicentury tree-ring records of climate anomalies and Spruce beetle outbreaks could provide insight into the dynamics of forest growth and its response to environmental changes.},

abstract = {Tree species like Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (Douglas-fir) are sensitive to climate cycles and show well defined growth rings. The careful selection of dominant trees with circular trunk section allow the analysis of tree growth trajectories. In this study, we used direct measurements of basal area increment (BAI) to explain biological periodicity and forecast basal area growth of Douglas-fir growing in Western Mexico. To remove the age effect on tree growth we also ran the analysis in terms of cambial age. Results showed significant (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05) correlation between BAI and precipitation from January to July. We found periodicities in tree growth of 7, 21, 27 and 60 years. However, the 60-year period, was determinant to build an ARIMA model (0,1,1), to forecast BAI for the next decades. Tree growth projections suggest reduced BAI in mature dominant trees for the next decades. Decreased tree-growth is an unexpected result, as BAI in dominant trees remains constant up to the biological age. Our finding is concurrent with a general decrement in tree growth in other forests of the world due to water stress, which suggests that the future climatic variability may worsen health conditions of Douglas-fir forests in North Mexico. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2016 Coordinaci{\{}{\'{o}}{\}}n de Revistas Institucionales.},

abstract = {This long-term experiment in Maine, U.S.A., was designed to provide information on the best silvicultural practices for managing stands of mixed northern conifers in northeastern U.S.A. We evaluated growth and yield and changes in species composition, quality, and structure during the first 40 years of the experiment. Replicated treatments include the selection system, uniform shelterwood, unregulated harvesting, and diameter-limit cutting. The new cohort established under three-stage shelterwood was subsequently left untreated or precommercially thinned. Between-treatment differences in net volume growth were not significant (?? = 0.10), though gross volume growth differed significantly for managed vs. unmanaged, selection vs. shelterwood, and shelterwood vs. diameter-limit treatments. A three-stage shelterwood method with precommercial thinning 10 years following final overstory removal resulted in good control of hardwoods and hemlock and a dramatic increase in spruce and fir. The selection system on a 5-year cutting cycle resulted in increased hemlock, spruce, and fir, with a decrease in hardwood species. If the primary goal were production, even-aged management would most likely be preferred. We recommend a two-stage shelterwood method as applied in this experiment with some modification to improve species composition and stand quality. Stand quality (proportion of stand volume in cull trees) and species composition was influenced by treatment.},

abstract = {Alpine treelines are often induced by a threshold of minimum temperatures above which tree growth is generally not possible anymore. However, this worldwide pattern may not account for more drought-prone mountains, where changes in precipitation can also affect ecosystem functioning and productivity at higher elevations. Here, we aim to determine if tree-ring formation in ecotones along the Pyrenees indeed primarily depends on temperature means or also reflects hydroclimatic changes. The mean duration of the growing season at Pyrenean treelines was 177 days, lasting from mid-May to early November, which corresponds to a mean root-zone temperature of 8.2 C. Temperatures during the early and late growing season were most critical for mountain pine growth at highest elevations, and above average spring temperatures also contributed to radial enlargement of tracheids. Sites showing more similar soil temperatures also presented more similar long-term growth trends indicating that local conditions trace regional influences on growth. Nevertheless, more wet conditions in summer enhanced growth at treelines subjected to more Mediterranean influence and therefore having a higher summer water deficit. A broader perspective reveals that soil moisture availability during spring and summer, however, also influence ring width formation at other treelines located in mid-latitude mountains separating temperate and semi-arid biomes. Our results suggest re-evaluating the idea of purely temperature-limited treelines, especially in mid-latitude mountains that experience moisture seasonality or where precipitation decreases with increasing elevation.},

abstract = {In this study, compatible height and diameter increment models were fitted for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), using the relationship between diameter and height growth. It was assumed that tree diameter increment is directly proportional to height increment, and the proportionality constant is a function of competition and site productivity. The results showed that the fit statistics are comparable with results of other studies, with adjusted R2 ranging from 30{\%} to 50{\%}. A validation test of the models, using independent permanent sample plots data, showed that the short-term predictions of the models for both pure and mixedwood stands are fairly unbiased. The models also gave reasonable average height growth and diameter growth trajectories for pure stands of the three species and also projected long-term mixedwood (aspen - white spruce mixture) volume growth dynamics reasonably well. The models also projected reasonably well (i) the effect of increasing initial stem density on average diameter and height, and (ii) the stand volume compared with an older version the Mixedwood Growth Model (ver. 2000A). It was concluded that explicitly linking tree height and diameter increment models does not only have a solid ecological basis, but it also results in a compatible prediction of tree growth and stand dynamics.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the basal area growth of Norway spruce stands subjected to different management strategies; specifically, even-aged (EA) stands treated with thinning from below and uneven-aged (UEA) stands treated with selective cutting. Analysis was based on extensive empirical data obtained from permanent long-term experiments established in 23 even-aged and 26 uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in Southern and Central Finland. The specific goals were to determine whether there are differences in: (a) the relationship between the stocking level and the stand basal area growth, (b) the stand basal area growth rates at a given stocking level, and (c) the stand basal area growth responses to cuttings between EA and UEA stands. A model-based approach was adopted in the analysis. Modelling was used to describe general trends and patterns in the data, emphasising the effects of overall stand density, cutting intensity, and management strategy on post-treatment stand growth. A model for a stand basal-area growth was fitted as a mixed linear model to the pooled data from EA and UEA stands. Model simulations were conducted to elucidate how the treatment of stands affects the predicted stand basal area growth. The analysis revealed a clear general effect of stocking level on stand basal area growth for all data. Growth increased with increasing stocking density. There was a significant difference in the stand basal area growth of EA stands and UEA stands. The growth of UEA stands was ca. 20{\%} smaller than that of EA stands. There were also major differences in the timing and magnitude of the growth response to cutting between EA and UEA stands. Post treatment growth was noticeably slower in UEA stands than in EA stands, especially during the first 10 years after cutting. The results clearly show that the growth response of the trees remaining in EA stands is faster and greater than that in UEA stands, enhancing the stand basal area growth.},

The proportion of area in canopy gaps ranged from 32{\%} in northern temperate forests to 73{\%} in subalpine forests. Evenly distributed developmental gaps were dominant but permanent openings created by edaphic components and by shrub communities were also common, particularly in subboreal forests. Abundant gaps, large gap sizes, high numbers of gap makers per gap and frequent gap expansion events suggest that gaps have long tenure in these forests. Snapped stems and standing dead mortality were the most common modes of mortality in all forest types resulting in little forest floor disturbance, creating few germination sites for seedling establishment. We found high mean light levels (16-27{\%} full sun) and little difference between non-gap and gap light environments. Our results suggest that gap dynamics in these forests differ fundamentally from those in temperate and tropical forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Modern forestry has been evolving towards multiple-use of forests and maintenance of biodiversity. Interest in integrating natural forest dynamics into management planning and silvicultural practices has increased as a result of concerns related to biodiversity values and maintaining ecological functions in managed forests. Taking advantage of naturally formed advance regeneration to create a new forest is one way of emulating natural forest dynamics, especially in spruce forests. However, efficient use of advance regeneration requires knowledge about factors influencing their performance. Light is important for growth and for crown, shoot and needle morphology of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Crown morphology varies from a conical and deep crown form in relatively highlight environments to the typical ''umbrella'' form in the understorey shade. Shoots and needles developed in shade are flatter and experience less self-shading than those developed in more light. Needle orientation is horizontal in shade and more vertically inclined in light. The number of nodal and internodal branches increases with increasing light. Tree shoot characteristics are strongly correlated and highly dependent on growing conditions, particularly light. There is a correlation between shoot and needle mass and other shoot variables of current and consecutive year's growth. The strongest correlations are between length of the shoot and needle mass of the shoot, and the length of the shoot and number of needles on the shoot. Needle length was not as sensitive to the light environment. However, needle width and thickness increased with canopy openness. This paper presents a review of selected literature on the relationships between different tree variables and ecophysiological factors that influence the response and acclimation of Norway spruce advance regeneration to release. The results indicate that crown, shoot and needle characteristics could reflect the acclimation to light conditions and indicate the performance of advance regeneration after release.},

abstract = {The distributions of many high-elevation tree species have shifted as a result of recent climate change; however, there is substantial variability in the movement of alpine treelines at local to regional scales. In this study, we derive records of tree growth and establishment from nine alpine treeline ecotones in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, characterise the influence of seasonal climate variables on four tree species (Abies lasiocarpa, Larix lyallii, Picea engelmannii, Pinus albicaulis) and estimate the degree to which treeline movement in the twentieth century has lagged or exceeded the rate predicted by recent temperature warming. The growth and establishment records revealed a widespread increase in radial growth, establishment frequency and stand density beginning in the mid-twentieth century. Coinciding with a period of warming summer temperatures and favourable moisture availability, these changes appear to have supported upslope treeline advance at all sites (range, 0.23–2.00 m/year; mean, 0.83 + 0.67 m/year). However, relationships with seasonal climate variables varied between species, and the rates of treeline movement lagged those of temperature warming in most cases. These results indicate that future climate change impacts on treelines in the region are likely to be moderated by species composition and to occur more slowly than anticipated based on temperature warming alone.},

abstract = {Mast-seeding conifers such as Picea glauca exhibit synchronous production of large seed crops over wide areas, suggesting climate factors as possible triggers for episodic high seed production. Rapidly changing climatic conditions may thus alter the tempo and spatial pattern of masting of dominant species with potentially far-reaching ecological consequences. Understanding the future reproductive dynamics of ecosystems including boreal forests, which may be dominated by mast-seeding species, requires identifying the specific cues that drive variation in reproductive output across landscape gradients and among years. Here we used annual data collected at three sites spanning an elevation gradient in interior Alaska, USA between 1986 and 2011 to produce the first quantitative models for climate controls over both seedfall and seed viability in P. glauca, a dominant boreal conifer. We identified positive associations between seedfall and increased summer precipitation and decreased summer warmth in all years except for the year prior to seedfall. Seed viability showed a contrasting response, with positive correlations to summer warmth in all years analyzed except for one, and an especially positive response to warm and wet conditions in the seedfall year. Finally, we found substantial reductions in reproductive potential of P. glauca at high elevation due to significantly reduced seed viability there. Our results indicate that major variation in the reproductive potential of this species may occur in different landscape positions in response to warming, with decreasing reproductive success in areas prone to drought stress contrasted with increasing success in higher elevation areas currently limited by cool summer temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

abstract = {Monitoring changes in vegetation at high-latitude and alpine treeline ecotones is critical for characterizing changes to carbon and energy budgets, plant species richness, and habitat suitability and is often considered a bellwether of a changing climate. Herein, we used transects of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to identify alpine treeline ecotones in the Yukon Territory of Canada, and assessed changes in vegetation greenness using a time-series of Landsat imagery over a 30 year period from 1985 to 2015. Specifically, we calculated the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from annual Landsat composites and assessed temporal trends within 500 m of detected forest-lines (i.e., transition point from continuous forest into treeline ecotones) using Theil-Sen's nonparametric regression. Across 74 detected treeline ecotones, 27.5{\%} of Landsat pixels displayed a significant positive trend in EVI and 5.6{\%} of pixels displayed a significant negative trend (p {\textless} 0.05). By using ALS data to determine vegetation structural class, we found that non-treed pixels had the highest percentage of significant positive trends in vegetation greenness (40.8{\%}), followed by shrubs (30.5{\%}), with lower percentages in sparse forests (18.9{\%}) and open/dense forests (13.3{\%}). These results suggest herbaceous and shrub vegetation types are undergoing the most significant changes in greenness, likely due to increases in shrub cover and herbaceous biomass in areas associated with these alpine treeline ecotones. The limited increases in EVI in forests likely indicates that vegetation cover is changing less rapidly in forests than in shrub and herbaceous vegetation types. Moreover, EVI may not be capturing increased height growth in forests near the treeline. Combining ALS data and Landsat time-series data provides a useful approach to locate and characterize alpine treeline ecotones, and enables the direct assessment of which vegetation structural classes are experiencing the greatest greening trends, thereby providing new insights to ecosystem change.},

abstract = {Choosing drought-tolerant planting stock in reforestation programs may help adapt forests to climate change. To inform such reforestation strategies, we test lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Doug. ex Loud. var latifolia Englm.) population response to drought, and infer potential benefits of a northward transfer of seeds from drier, southern environments. The objective is addressed by combining dendroecological growth analysis with long-term genetic field trials. Over 500 trees originating from 23 populations across western North America were destructively sampled in three experimental sites in southern British Columbia, representing a climate warming scenario. Growth after 32 years from provenances transferred southward or northward over long distances was significantly lower than growth of local populations. All populations were affected by a severe natural drought event in 2002. The provenances from the most southern locations showed the highest drought tolerance but low productivity. Local provenances were productive and drought tolerant. Provenances from the boreal north showed lower productivity and less drought tolerance on southern test sites than all other sources, implying that maladaptation to drought may prevent boreal populations from taking full advantage of more favorable growing conditions under projected climate change.

abstract = {Predicting long-term trends in forest growth requires accurate characterisation of how the relationship between forest productivity and climatic stress varies across climatic regimes. Using a network of over two million tree-ring observations spanning North America and a space-for-time substitution methodology, we forecast climate impacts on future forest growth. We explored differing scenarios of increased water-use efficiency (WUE) due to CO2-fertilisation, which we simulated as increased effective precipitation. In our forecasts: (1) climate change negatively impacted forest growth rates in the interior west and positively impacted forest growth along the western, southeastern and northeastern coasts; (2) shifting climate sensitivities offset positive effects of warming on high-latitude forests, leaving no evidence for continued 'boreal greening'; and (3) it took a 72{\%} WUE enhancement to compensate for continentally averaged growth declines under RCP 8.5. Our results highlight the importance of locally adapted forest management strategies to handle regional differences in growth responses to climate change.},

@article{Kneeshaw2002a,
abstract = {An increased pressure to use silvicultural techniques not based on clear-cutting followed by planting has led to an interest in systems that take advantage of existing understory seedlings (advance regeneration). Earlier studies have suggested that following harvesting, understory seedlings may experience growth reductions before responding with growth increases. We hypothesize that this "growth shock" following release results because seedlings are ill adjusted to the new growing conditions and that this can be investigated through a comparison of growth in different parts of the tree over a 6-year period. This study compares the growth response of three size classes of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings to a partial overstory removal in relatively dry conifer forests of central British Columbia. Growth was evaluated in four parts of the studied trees: radial increment in roots, in the base of the stem, and in branches, as well as leader height growth extension. Our findings show that following release from the overstory, early growth increases were largest in the roots and stems irrespective of the species or the size class. Differences between the species were observed in greater absolute height growth for pine, whereas Douglas-fir invested in greater stem growth, especially in the larger individuals. Important differences also occurred temporally. Both species (and all size classes) responded with an immediate increase in root growth followed, after a 1-year delay, by an increase in stem growth. Branch radial increment (for pine) and leader height growth (both species), however, experienced 2 to 3 year growth reductions before responding. It is therefore suggested that individuals restore the root-shoot balance by greater initial investments to root growth to offset the increased transpiration losses associated with the greater light and higher temperature conditions and the relative changes in the photosynthetic versus nutrient uptake capacity following the canopy opening. Foresters may therefore be able to manipulate tree growth responses by using an appropriate degree of overstory removal or opening size.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society of American Foresters. In 1950, the US Forest Service initiated a cutting practice level (CPL) study on the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine on the basis of findings of a national appraisal of forestland management. Silvicultural treatments, including the selection system with 5- and 15-year cutting cycles, fixed diameter-limit cutting, and variants of commercial clearcutting, were chosen to represent "High-order," "Good," "Fair," and "Poor" cutting practices as then defined for eastern spruce-fir (Picea-Abies; northern conifer) forests. After 60 years, selection treatments have maintained a wide distribution of tree sizes, increased the proportion of mature spruce, and decreased the proportion of hardwoods; selection cutting on a 15-year cycle resulted in the highest current stand value. Fixed diameter-limit cutting resulted in the greatest harvest revenue but degraded residual stand composition, structure, and value. Outcomes of commercial clearcutting varied as a function of treatment (none, repeated harvest, or rehabilitation) after the first harvest. After 60 years, the proportion of acceptable growing stock was highest in selection and rehabilitation treatments and lowest in fixed diameter-limit and commercial clearcut treatments. Findings confirm that long-term outcomes of silvicultural treatments with attention to residual stand condition surpass those managed for short-term financial gains with regard to residual stand structure, value, and quality.},

Differences in the GSI values were observed between the sites. Fish originating from the sites with higher salinity has significantly lower GSI values and in addition, lay fewer eggs per unit of size (total length, body weight, age) than those from the other sampling sites.

Based on thorough examination of the scientific article introducing EPS, I show that I) EPS was not meant to be a measure for the suitability of tree-ring data for climate reconstruction, and II) that the frequently used – but arbitrarily chosen – threshold of 0.85 was not meant to be used in combination with EPS. Instead, the less frequently used subsample signal strength (SSS) was intended for a respective application, i.e. as a measure of decreasing predictive power of transfer functions due to reductions in the sample size of underlying tree-ring series back in time. I conclude that classical transfer function quality statistics should be preferred over the erroneous application of EPS in the context of evaluating the suitability of dendrochronological data for climate reconstructions.},

abstract = {A mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak has recently spread into boreal forests, with unknown consequences for this ecosystem. We intensively sampled 12 stands affected by the current outbreak in northern British Columbia to determine the potential of western boreal forests to recover from this novel disturbance. We sampled the species composition, size structure, and spatial distribution (using 5 m × 5 m subplots, 40 per stand) of live and dead trees and used a variety of analyses, including ordinations, to assess potential developmental trajectories of stands. Advance regeneration (stems {\textless} 10 m tall) varied greatly in abundance among stands (50–18 280 stems{\textperiodcentered}ha−1). However, most subplots contained at least one individual; only three stands had many empty subplots. We conclude that most stands have enough advance regeneration and residual canopy trees to form a nearly continuous new canopy. Ordinations indicate that species composition will shift substantially and become more divergent among stands. Species of high economic value will remain common, though, and active management will not be necessary in most stands to maintain productive forests. However, this novel disturbance will have very different effects on these forests than the typical fire-disturbance regime and is likely to deflect these forests into new successional trajectories.},

Two conceptually simple methods of using multiple calibration intervals are applied to response functions.

They allow for forward or backward evolution by maintaining a fixed beginning or ending year, respectively. Moving response functions (MRF) are based on a fixed number of years progressively slid across time to compute the response coefficients. The application of ERF and MRF is illustrated by applying them to two Western American tree-ring collectiions, one from Torrey pines growing along the Southern California coast, the other from Douglas fir in east-central Idaho.},

Estimates of carbon use efficiency, aboveground NPP, and post-disturbance C dynamics following the harvest of DF49 in 2011 showed discrepancies between modelled estimates and independent data, which were attributed to underestimates of coarse litterfall in previous field studies and to uncertainty in the production, turnover, and post-mortality decay of non merchantable woody biomass in the CBM-CFS3. Despite these issues, the results provide further evidence of the potential use of tree-ring data to expand the availability of long-term estimates of annual ecosystem production and their ability to increase our understanding of forest C dynamics.},

@article{DArrigo2008,
abstract = {An anomalous reduction in forest growth indices and temperature sensitivity has been detected in tree-ring width and density records from many circumpolar northern latitude sites since around the middle 20th century. This phenomenon, also known as the "divergence problem", is expressed as an offset between warmer instrumental temperatures and their underestimation in reconstruction models based on tree rings. The divergence problem has potentially significant implications for large-scale patterns of forest growth, the development of paleoclimatic reconstructions based on tree-ring records from northern forests, and the global carbon cycle. Herein we review the current literature published on the divergence problem to date, and assess its possible causes and implications. The causes, however, are not well understood and are difficult to test due to the existence of a number of covarying environmental factors that may potentially impact recent tree growth. These possible causes include temperature-induced drought stress, nonlinear thresholds or time-dependent responses to recent warming, delayed snowmelt and related changes in seasonality, and differential growth/climate relationships inferred for maximum, minimum and mean temperatures. Another possible cause of the divergence described briefly herein is 'global dimming', a phenomenon that has appeared, in recent decades, to decrease the amount of solar radiation available for photosynthesis and plant growth on a large scale. It is theorized that the dimming phenomenon should have a relatively greater impact on tree growth at higher northern latitudes, consistent with what has been observed from the tree-ring record. Additional potential causes include "end effects" and other methodological issues that can emerge in standardization and chronology development, and biases in instrumental target data and its modeling. Although limited evidence suggests that the divergence may be anthropogenic in nature and restricted to the recent decades of the 20th century, more research is needed to confirm these observations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We quantified climate–growth relationships using uni- and multivariate techniques at different temporal scales.

abstract = {The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been described by some as a long-lived El Ni{\~{n}}o-like pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes having distinct spatial and temporal characteristics of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: "cool" PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and again from 1947-1976, while "warm" PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations-at a range of varying time scales-can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities-one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years-the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.},

Managers must consider the indirect effects of forest operations on caribou through their impacts on caribou mortality factors, such as predation. Lichens remain important. Habitat destruction may in some cases be the ultimate cause of population decline. Reactions of caribou to disturbance vary, and remain controversial; more research is needed. Multiple resource managers of boreal commercial forests should identify sensitive components of caribou range – calving grounds, rutting locations, wintering areas, and travel routes among them – and prescribe for these areas in forest management plants. Ways of accommodating caribou in commercial forests are not well established, but some examples suggest how this might be done. Most importantly, areas that have been proven by their continued use to contain all necessary requirements for caribou survival should not be physically altered until their essential qualities and functions are better understood.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a notable increase in the number of research projects engaged in building supra-long (multi-millennial) tree-ring chronologies. Together with a growing awareness of the potential for anthropogenic climate change, this work is shifting the focus of dendroclimatology. Instead of a more traditional interpretation of tree-ring data in terms of annual-to-decadal timescale climate variability the emphasis is increasingly placed on century timescale changes. We review a number of problems with the interpretation of low-frequency climate change in tree-ring derived data. Perhaps the most significant is the high-pass filtering effect of “standardization” techniques commonly used in chronology construction to remove age-related sample bias in the original tree growth measurement data. These techniques effectively remove low-frequency variability and with it the evidence of long-term climate change. Other forcings may also be ‘corrupting' the climate signal in the recent period (that used for calibrating the climate signal). Differences in the origin of the samples or changes in site ecology may also impart an inhomogeneity in the response of tree growth through time, hence violating the fundamental assumption of uniformitarianism that underpins proxy climate research.},

abstract = {How climate change will affect tree growth across species' geographic and climatic ranges remains a critical knowledge gap. Tree-ring data were analyzed from 33 interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) stands spanning wide geographic and climatic conditions in the interior of British Columbia to gain insights into how within-species growth responses to climate can vary based on local environmental conditions over a broad climatic and geographic range, including populations growing at the species' range and climatic margins. Populations growing in relatively warm and dry climates had growth patterns correlated mostly with annual precipitation, whereas populations growing in high-elevation wet and cold climates had growth patterns correlated with snowfall, winter and annual temperatures, and ocean-atmosphere climate systems. Populations growing at climatic extremes (e.g., coldest, driest, warmest) in each study region had the strongest responses to climate. Projected climate change may negatively influence Douglas-fir productivity across most of its range, and populations growing near the species' climatic limits may provide early and strong indications of future responses.},

abstract = {On the basis of nine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and ten European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) thinning experiments in Germany, for which both residual and removed stock had been registered first during 1870, I scrutinize how moderate and heavy thinning from below (B-, C-grade) affects the production of merchantable volume compared with light thinning (A-grade). In relation to A-grade, cumulative merchantable volume (CV) of B- and C-grade amounts in average to 103-107{\%} in juvenile and to 97-102{\%} in mature Norway spruce stands. The corresponding findings for European beech are 101-106{\%} and 94-102{\%}. CV of individual stands varies between 89{\%} and 130{\%} for Norway spruce and 73{\%} and 155{\%} for European beech (CV of A-grade = 100{\%}). These findings are substantiated by the relation between stand density (SDI) and periodic annual increment (PAI). On the B- and C-grade plots of spruce and beech, respectively, SDI was reduced down to 41-91{\%} and 31-83{\%} of the A-grade. When SDI is reduced in young stands, PAI follows a unimodal curve. Norway spruce's PAI culminates in 109{\%} if SDI is reduced to 59{\%}; European beech's PAI culminates in 123{\%} when density is reduced to 50{\%}. Whereas Norway spruce's growth reacts most positively on thinning under poor site conditions and with increment reduction on favourable sites, European beech behaves oppositely. With stand development the culmination point of the unimodal relation moves towards maximum density, so that in older stands PAI follows the increasing pattern, which is the left portion of a unimodal curve. A model is presented which apparently unifies contradictory patterns of stand density-growth reactions by integrating relative stand density, average tree size and site fertility effects, and makes the findings operable for forest management. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

@article{Huxman2003a,
abstract = {We evaluated the hypothesis that CO(2) uptake by a subalpine, coniferous forest is limited by cool temperature during the growing season. Using the eddy covariance approach we conducted observations of net ecosystem CO(2) exchange (NEE) across two growing seasons. When pooled for the entire growing season during both years, light-saturated net ecosystem CO(2) exchange (NEE(sat)) exhibited a temperature optimum within the range 7-12 degrees C. Ecosystem respiration rate ( R(e)), calculated as the y-intercept of the NEE versus photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) relationship, increased with increasing temperature, causing a 15{\%} reduction in net CO(2) uptake capacity for this ecosystem as temperatures increased from typical early season temperatures of 7 degrees C to typical mid-season temperatures of 18 degrees C. The ecosystem quantum yield and the ecosystem PPFD compensation point, which are measures of light-utilization efficiency, were highest during the cool temperatures of the early season, and decreased later in the season at higher temperatures. Branch-level measurements revealed that net photosynthesis in all three of the dominant conifer tree species exhibited a temperature optimum near 10 degrees C early in the season and 15 degrees C later in the season. Using path analysis, we statistically isolated temperature as a seasonal variable, and identified the dynamic role that temperature exhibits in controlling ecosystem fluxes early and late in the season. During the spring, an increase in temperature has a positive effect on NEE, because daytime temperatures progress from near freezing to near the photosynthetic temperature optimum, and R(e )values remain low. During the middle of the summer an increase in temperature has a negative effect on NEE, because inhibition of net photosynthesis and increases in R(e). When taken together, the results demonstrate that in this high-elevation forest ecosystem CO(2) uptake is not limited by cool-temperature constraints on photosynthetic processes during the growing-season, as suggested by some previous ecophysiological studies at the branch and needle levels. Rather, it is warm temperatures in the mid-summer, and their effect on ecosystem respiration, that cause the greatest reduction in the potential for forest carbon sequestration.},

@article{Bekker2005,
abstract = {The development and maintenance of several types of visually striking vegetation patterns are controlled by positive feedback between pattern and process. These patterns are particularly common at ecotones, where the influence of positive feedback may affect the position and dynamics of the boundary between the adjacent biotic communities. In this study, I use dendrochronology to examine the role of feedback between existing trees and the establishment and survival of seedlings in the advancement of linear, finger-like strips of subalpine forest in Glacier National Park, Montana. A general upslope, windward to leeward pattern of older trees followed by progressively younger trees was evident in all sample transects, although in some cases this pattern repeated several times along the length of a transect, with each repetition originating leeward of boulders. Overall advancement rates varied from 0.28 to 0.62 m yr-1. The oldest trees established in the early to mid-1700s, but establishment and advancement increased rapidly after 1850, and peaked in the early 1900s. In addition, almost all seedlings established within 5 m downwind of existing trees between 1700 and 1850, while establishment beyond this distance was common after 1850. These patterns suggest that existing trees facilitate leeward seedling establishment and survival, by depositing wind-blown snow. These seedlings in turn modify their leeward environment, thus allowing forest advancement in a linear pattern. Feedback was critical for the survival of seedlings before 1800, and strongly controlled advancement between about 1800 and 1850, but appears to have had little effect on establishment patterns since that time. The importance of feedback between pattern and process may change over time and space as a result of changes in climatic conditions or biotic surroundings. {\textcopyright} 2005 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

@article{Coulthard2020,
abstract = {Climate change has contributed to recent declines in mountain snowpack 18 and earlier runoff, which in turn have intensified hydrological droughts in western North 19 America. Climate model projections suggest that continued and severe snowpack 20 reductions are expected over the 21st century, with profound consequences for 21 ecosystems and human welfare. Yet the current understanding of trends and variability 22 in mountain snowpack is limited by the relatively short and strongly temperature 23 forced observational record. Motivated by the urgent need to better understand 24 snowpack dynamics in a long-term, spatially coherent framework, here we examine 25 snow-growth relationships in western North American tree-ring chronologies. We 26 present an extensive network of snow-sensitive proxy data to support high space/time 27 resolution paleosnow reconstruction, quantify and interpret the type and spatial density 28 of snow related signals in tree-ring records, and examine the potential for regional bias 29 in the tree-ring based reconstruction of different snow drought types (dry versus warm). 30 Our results indicate three distinct snow-growth relationships in tree-ring chronologies: 31 moisture-limited snow proxies that include a spring temperature signal, moisture-32 limited snow proxies lacking a spring temperature signal, and energy-limited snow 33 proxies. Each proxy type is based on distinct physiological tree-growth mechanisms 34 related to topographic and climatic site conditions, and provides unique information 35 on mountain snowpack dynamics that can be capitalized upon within a statistical 36 reconstruction framework. This work provides a platform and foundational background 37 required for the accelerated production of high-quality annually resolved snowpack 38 reconstructions from regional to high ({\textless}12 km) spatial scales in western North America 39 and, by extension, will support an improved understanding of the vulnerability of 40 snowmelt-derived water resources to natural variability and future climate warming.},

@article{Wiley2018a,
abstract = {The effects of climate change on tree growth in ecosystems limited by cold temperature remain unclear. In some cases, growth may increase, but because warmer temperatures can increase water stress, growth may also decline. As climate changes in the sub-boreal spruce (SBS) zone in central British Columbia, hybrid white spruce (Picea engelmannii × glauca)—a dominant but drought-intolerant species of this region—is predicted to decline over much of its range, while species such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) are likely to replace spruce. To see whether these shifts are already evident, we examined recent trends in basal area increment (BAI) of these two species over the past 50 yr (1961–2010) and explored relationships with climate variables in the SBS zone across a range of sites varying in water availability due to differences in climate and soil moisture regimes. In addition, we analyzed wood $\delta$13C during this period and root carbohydrate reserve (NSC) concentrations at the end of this period as indicators of water and carbon stress, respectively, to help interpret growth trends and climate relationships among sites. Spruce BAI was negatively associated with spring and/or summer temperature on all sites, but growth was never negatively correlated with temperature in Douglas-fir. For both species, lower BAI on the driest site was accompanied by higher $\delta$13C and lower root NSC reserve concentrations, particularly starch, consistent with drought stress reducing water and carbon availability for growth. However, there was no indication that the negative growth response to temperature was more pronounced on drier sites, as the only growth decline in spruce occurred on a mesic site with lower $\delta$13C. We conclude that rising temperatures are likely to negatively impact the growth of spruce more than Douglas-fir in the SBS zone, supporting predictions that spruce will decline and be replaced by other species like Douglas-fir. And while rising temperatures may have already reduced growth on some sites, these declines are not clearly related to increasing drought stress but may relate to effects on the timing of snowmelt.},
