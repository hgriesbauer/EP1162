abstract = {The impact of winter harvesting on regeneration 50 years after an experimental diameter-limit cutting was examined in mixed deciduous-coniferous ecosystems of southern Quebec, Canada. The study was conducted in La Mauricie National Park, Quebec, Canada. Regeneration data in two balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) ecosystem types were analyzed. Comparisons between uncut and cut stands were obtained from a total of 63 sample plots. For both ecosystems, there were no significant differences between uncut and cut plots for regeneration density and stocking. The most abundant regeneration species were balsam fir, red spruce, sugar maple, red maple (Acer rubrum L.), yellow birch and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). The type of diameter-limit cutting described in the study did not affect regeneration density and stocking but its impact on productivity, timber quality and genetics is still unknown.

abstract = {The long-term effects of high-intensity diameter-limit cuttings conducted in the winter and summer of the 1940s and 1950s on the dynamics of softwood and mixedwood stands in southeastern Quebec were compared. Changes in composition and stand structure over a 50 year period were studied using 18 permanent sample plots located in the Lac-M{\'{e}}tis Seigneury observation area measured in 1950, 1960, 1970, and 2003. Winter logging operations were conducted between 1942 and 1949, and summer logging operations were conducted between 1958 and 1960. The interaction between cuttings and the 1950s and 1970s spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)) outbreaks that occurred in the area affected forest dynamics. For the two logging operation types, the most abundant softwood species observed before logging and in 2003 was balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), whereas white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) were the most abundant hardwood species. Changes in the overstory composition were more significant in the summer logging operations than in the winter ones. The soft-wood cover type observed before winter logging was maintained in 2003. Following summer logging, an important increase in the proportion of birch species was observed. The softwood cover type observed before logging had changed to a mixedwood cover type by 2003. Forest dynamics differences between the two types of logging were the result of interactions between the density and composition of advance regeneration, the microsite conditions after logging, and the length and severity of spruce budworm outbreaks.

abstract = {Understanding the factors regulating the composition and abundance of natural regeneration in forest ecosystems is critical to sustainable management worldwide. Using a long-term silvicultural experiment in Maine, we partitioned the variation in natural regeneration and examined the contribution of overstory and understory vegetation (biotic factors), substrate and soil attributes (abiotic factors), and silvicultural treatment. We hypothesized that silvicultural treatment (single-tree selection with 5, 10, and 20-year cutting cycles and diameter-limit cutting) would be less influential than abiotic and biotic factors in structuring regeneration pattern. Overall, treatment and site (biotic and abiotic) factors accounted for 26{\%} of the variation in regeneration species composition, highlighting stochasticity of the regeneration process. In support of our hypothesis, regeneration pattern that could be explained was primarily associated with local site factors; overstory and understory vegetation uniquely accounted for 16{\%} of the variation in species composition. Substrate and soil attributes along with silvicultural treatment accounted for 4{\%} of variation, and uniquely accounted for 2{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively. In support of earlier reports, shifts toward hardwood dominance were apparent at early stages of cohort development and were associated with high harvest intensities. Our findings suggested that overstory and under-story vegetation exhibit greater control over regeneration patterns than substrate and soil attributes, or silvicultural treatment, in partially harvested Acadian Forest mixedwood stands, and also indicated the potential for composition control through selective overstory removal.},

Ingrowth, accretion, and mortality of individual trees (≥0.5 in. dbh) are followed on permanent sample plots before and after harvests, and at about 5-year intervals between harvests. Differences in growth between the reference and treated stands and among several of the treatments have been documented. There have also been changes in species composition and stand quality. Over the decades this experiment has yielded valuable answers to questions it was designed to address and insights into many issues that were not anticipated when it was planned.

abstract = {We examined the growth of understory conifers, following partial or complete deciduous canopy removal, in a field study established in two regions in Canada. In central British Columbia, we studied the responses of three species (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss × Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm., and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and in northwestern Quebec, we studied one species (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Stem and root diameter and height growth were measured 5 years before and 3 years after harvesting. Both root and stem diameter growth increased sharply following release but seedlings showed greater root growth, suggesting that in the short term, improvement in soil resource capture and transport, and presumably stability, may be more important than an increase in stem diameter and height growth. Response was strongly size dependent, which appears to reflect greater demand for soil resources as well as higher light levels and greater tree vigour before release for taller individuals. Growth ratios could not explain the faster response generally attributed to true fir species or the unusual swift response of spruces. Good prerelease vigour of spruces, presumably favoured by deciduous canopies, could explain their rapid response to release.

abstract = { The ratio between projected leaf area (LA) and cross-sectional sapwood area (SA) of dominant and codominant balsam fir trees (Abiesbalsamea (L.) Mill.) was determined in 24 forest stands across the province of Quebec. Various physical factors proposed in the Whitehead hydraulic model, and some of the easily measured surrogates of these factors, were tested for their influence on LA:SA ratios. Average growing season vapor pressure deficit, temperature, precipitation, and stand drainage class did not significantly influence LA:SA ratios. On the other hand, LA:SA ratios were positively influenced by sapwood permeability (k), tree height, and crown length. As suggested by the model, there was a positive correlation between sapwood permeability and LA:SA ratio and a negative correlation between tree height or crown length and LA/(SA k). Increases in sapwood permeability with tree age were associated with longer tracheids having larger lumen diameters. Of the various empirical factors tested, only site quality, 5-year basal area growth, and age had a significant influence on LA:SA ratios. Sapwood cross-sectional area at breast height by itself was a reasonable linear predictor of LA for all stands (LA = −0.158 + 0.709 SA BH , R 2 = 0.75). Using the variables that were previously determined to influence LA:SA ratios, stepwise regressions revealed that only crown length and 5-year basal area growth significantly improved linear predictions of LA based on sapwood area. However, the increase in R 2 was relatively modest, i.e., 0.83 for all three independent variables versus 0.75 for SA alone. The results from this study will be useful in integrating physiologically based measurements, such as growth efficiency, into standard forest inventory practices for balsam fir and thus could be beneficial in developing new silvicultural strategies for protecting Quebec's forest resource. },

abstract = {Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term ({\textgreater}50 yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives. As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems , such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity.},

abstract = {The determination of an optimal sequence of diameter distributions and selection harvests for uneven-aged stand management is formulated as a discrete-time optimal-control problem with bounded control variables and free-terminal point. An efficient programming technique utilizing gradients provides solutions that are stable and interpretable on the basis of economic principles. Methods and results are demonstrated using a whole-standdiameter-class simulator developed for northern hardwoods stands in Wisconsin. Examples in which the objective is present net worth maximization over a 150-year planning horizon with a 5-year cutting cycle suggest two types of optimal equilibrium stand structures: a downward-sloping diameter distribution if large value premiums are assigned to the largest diameter classes and a truncated diameter distribution if premiums for larger trees are gradual or absent. Transition strategies vary in length and harvest pattern depending on the stumpage value function used. It is emphasized that equilibrium management regimes developed with static analysis are not optimal when used as starting conditions in dynamic formulations. FOREST SCI. 3 1:45 1 4 6 2. ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS. Forest economics, optimal control theory, gradient projection method, nonlinear programming. THE INCORPORATION of even-aged stand growth and yield simulators into dynamic programming frameworks has improved the economic analysis of silvicultural investment decisions in stand-level even-aged management (Brodie and Kao 1979, Martin and Ek 198 1, Riitters and others 1982). Uneven-aged stand simulators cannot be readily incorporated into dynamic programming frameworks because the large number of decision variables involved would require long computation time and massive computer storage. We introduce a more efficient optimization technique based on optimal control theory and demonstrate its use in finding the optimal sequence of diameter distributions and selection harvests for an uneven-aged stand. The decision variables facing a forest manager interested in applying uneven-aged management at the stand level are (1) the cutting cycle length, and (2) the diameter distribution and species composition after each selection harvest during a given planning horizon. We use the optimization technique to solve the diameter distribution problem, and it can be expanded to analyze both cutting cycle length and species composition problems.},

Height growth of Picea rubens Sarg., Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr. saplings between 0.5 and 6.0 m in height was related to the proportion open sky (POS), using sapling height as a covariate. Height growth of T. canadensis equaled A. balsamea and exceeded P. rubens under very low light levels (POS {\textless} 0.1) but is much less responsive to both increasing POS and taller heights, reaching 50{\%} of its maximum height growth at a POS of only 0.09. Abies balsamea outgrew P. rubens under similar dark conditions; at higher light levels (POS {\textgreater} 0.10), both species grew similarly. Evidently, no feasible overstory manipulation of light alone can promote more rapid height development of P. rubens saplings over A. balsamea. A nonlinear light-prediction model using stand basal area is linked with height-growth prediction equations to quantify sapling development from 0.5 to 6 m. Depending on overstory density, P. rubens requires a height advantage of 0.14-0.33 m over a 0.5 m tall A. balsamea to reach a height of 6 m over the same time period. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {Understanding the response of tree regeneration following commercial thinning treatments can improve planning in managed forests dependent on natural regeneration. We used long-term commercial thinning experiments in eastern spruce-fir stands of Maine, USA, to test two hypotheses: (1) commercial thinning increases the density of tree regeneration and (2) tree regeneration density increases with increasing thinning intensity. A decade after thinning, densities of softwood and hardwood regeneration were 10 times greater in thinned stands than unthinned stands. The abundance of small softwood (0.11-0.60mtall) was highest in lower intensity thinning treatments, whereas medium (0.61-1.40mtall) and large (≥1.41mtall to 8.90 cm diameter at breast height) softwoods increased proportionally with thinning intensity, a pattern related to a higher rate of recruitment in more open stands created by heavier thinning. Hardwood density generally increased with thinning intensity and developed into a significant component of the large size class. Softwood regeneration density was higher in older spruce stands than younger fir stands, which may be due to greater abundance of advance regeneration, higher residual stand mortality, and greater harvest disturbance in older spruce stands. However, acceptable softwood stocking was achieved in all replicates of thinning treatments. Therefore, in addition to providing higher individual-tree growth and merchantable yield, commercial thinning in eastern spruce-fir stands also increases regeneration density. The rate of recruitment also increased as thinning intensity increased, thus stimulating understory regeneration similar to that of a shelterwood establishment cut.},

Karst.) after mountain forest selective cutting.-Forestry Studies | Metsandusli-kud Uurimused 55, 33-45. ISSN 1406-9954. Abstract. Models for predicting diameter increment in multi-storey spruce stands following mountain forest selective cutting (MFS) were developed. They were based on increment cores, tree ring analyses and stump registrations. The presented models rely upon time series data from 1600 trees in thirty-one Norway spruce stands in southeastern and central parts of Norway. The selective cuttings were heavy; on average two thirds of the standing volume were cut. The increment following the interventions was highly variable, resulting in large random variability in the models with R 2 varying between 0.18-0.31 for individual tree diameter growth and 0.40-0.50 for mean tree stand diameter growth. Dummy variables referring to three first 5-year periods after cutting were found to increase the precision and significantly reduce the random error. Selected models were validated using a test material from central Norway and also compared with the mostly applied Norwegian diameter increment models. Despite a large random variation in all models, the model performances appeared logical and the general fit to the data was acceptable. Based on tests, two diameter increment models are recommended for future yield prognoses in MFS. The models should also be of interest for wider use in other parts of the Nordic and Baltic boreal zone.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society of American Foresters. In 1950, the US Forest Service initiated a cutting practice level (CPL) study on the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine on the basis of findings of a national appraisal of forestland management. Silvicultural treatments, including the selection system with 5- and 15-year cutting cycles, fixed diameter-limit cutting, and variants of commercial clearcutting, were chosen to represent "High-order," "Good," "Fair," and "Poor" cutting practices as then defined for eastern spruce-fir (Picea-Abies; northern conifer) forests. After 60 years, selection treatments have maintained a wide distribution of tree sizes, increased the proportion of mature spruce, and decreased the proportion of hardwoods; selection cutting on a 15-year cycle resulted in the highest current stand value. Fixed diameter-limit cutting resulted in the greatest harvest revenue but degraded residual stand composition, structure, and value. Outcomes of commercial clearcutting varied as a function of treatment (none, repeated harvest, or rehabilitation) after the first harvest. After 60 years, the proportion of acceptable growing stock was highest in selection and rehabilitation treatments and lowest in fixed diameter-limit and commercial clearcut treatments. Findings confirm that long-term outcomes of silvicultural treatments with attention to residual stand condition surpass those managed for short-term financial gains with regard to residual stand structure, value, and quality.},

abstract = {Using inventory data from a long-term silviculture experiment in east-central Maine, spatial models were developed to analyze 28 years (1974-2002) of stand structural dynamics. Differences in spatial pattern, species mingling, height differentiation, and relative stand complexity index (rSCI) were compared among five treatments: commercial clear-cutting, fixed diameter-limit, 5 year single-tree selection, three-stage shelterwood (both with and without precommercial thinning), and unharvested natural areas. Regardless of treatment, regeneration events (whether induced by natural breakup of the overstory or by harvesting) increased aggregation in spatial pattern and reduced species mingling, more so in the commercial clearcut and fixed diameter-limit treatments where hardwood densities were highest. Regular spatial patterns were rare. Height differentiation values for individual trees and stand-level mean rSCI were generally highest in untreated natural areas and 5 year selection treatments, intermediate in commercial clearcut and fixed diameter-limit treatments, and lowest in three-stage shelterwood treatments. After a brief adjustment period, precommercial thinning in a shelterwood treated stand generally increased species mingling, height differentiation, and rSCI. Two untreated natural areas exhibited divergent pathways of structural development. Dynamics in uneven-aged selection treatments more closely resembled that of the untreated natural areas than did the shelterwood, commercial clearcut, or fixed diameter limit treatments.

abstract = {This long-term experiment in Maine, U.S.A., was designed to provide information on the best silvicultural practices for managing stands of mixed northern conifers in northeastern U.S.A. We evaluated growth and yield and changes in species composition, quality, and structure during the first 40 years of the experiment. Replicated treatments include the selection system, uniform shelterwood, unregulated harvesting, and diameter-limit cutting. The new cohort established under three-stage shelterwood was subsequently left untreated or precommercially thinned. Between-treatment differences in net volume growth were not significant (?? = 0.10), though gross volume growth differed significantly for managed vs. unmanaged, selection vs. shelterwood, and shelterwood vs. diameter-limit treatments. A three-stage shelterwood method with precommercial thinning 10 years following final overstory removal resulted in good control of hardwoods and hemlock and a dramatic increase in spruce and fir. The selection system on a 5-year cutting cycle resulted in increased hemlock, spruce, and fir, with a decrease in hardwood species. If the primary goal were production, even-aged management would most likely be preferred. We recommend a two-stage shelterwood method as applied in this experiment with some modification to improve species composition and stand quality. Stand quality (proportion of stand volume in cull trees) and species composition was influenced by treatment.},

@article{Thorpe2007,
abstract = {In the past 10 to 15 years, alternative silvicultural treatments involving partial harvesting have been developed for boreal forests, with the goal of achieving a balance between biodiversity maintenance and continued timber production. Most prior research has focussed on the impacts of partial harvesting on biological diversity, while stand dynamic responses remain little studied. In this paper we explore partial stand harvesting in the Canadian boreal - its rationale, current extent, and impact on stand dynamic patterns. Empirical studies from the boreal and elsewhere indicate that residual trees of many species respond to partial harvesting with enhanced growth, commonly showing a lagged response after which peak growth occurs five to 25 years following harvest. Post-harvest mortality is also prevalent but much more variable, with losses of residual trees ranging from nearly zero to more than 50{\%} above background mortality rates in the initial years following harvest. With the exception of strip cutting in parts of northern Ontario and Quebec (HARP/CPPTM), operational partial harvesting in the Canadian boreal currently involves very low levels of retention. Available data suggest that such low retention levels, particularly when spatially dispersed, generally result in unacceptably high rates of post-harvest mortality, which are unlikely to be offset by increases in residual tree growth. There is an urgent need for development of spatially explicit stand simulation models that will allow accurate yield predictions for partial harvest systems to assess their feasibility in boreal forest management.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {A white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) overstory of a 30+ year old stand was thinned or completely removed , releasing an advance regeneration of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.). The overstory was clear-cut (T0), thinned to 600 (T600) or to 1200 (T1200) stems/ha, or left uncut (control). Three years after release, understory responses were best demonstrated by decreasing specific leaf area with increasing release level and by changes to height and radial growth increments. Clear-cutting the overstory stalled the height growth in fir for two seasons and radial growth at the tree base for one season. Compared with the control, the 3-year height increment was proportionally greatest in intermediate trees of T600, and this treatment produced the overall best response in height growth. Complete birch removal produced the best radial growth response despite the initial growth check. However, no release treatment significantly affected the whole tree variables (aboveground biomass, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), live crown ratio) within the studied time frame. Shoot silhouette ratios were lowest in the completely released understory trees, while they were similar to those of the controls in all partial-release treatments. Tree sturdiness (height/DBH ratio) was 80-90 in most treatments except T0, where it declined to below 80. Despite this improvement, large trees in T0 have been damaged by wind and snow.
