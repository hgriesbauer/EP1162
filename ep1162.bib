abstract = {We examined the dynamics of the tree-seedling bank in old-growth, subalpine Picea engelmannii-Abies lasiocarpa forests in south-central British Columbia by collecting all individuals {\textless}1.3 m tall within belt transects at two sites (n = ca. 500 per site) and determining their height, basal diameter and age. Seedlings were up to 149 y old. Regressions showed that spruce 1-m tall averaged 65-y old and fir 92-y old. Age structures indicated that recruitment into the seedling bank was variable with time, but that individuals of both species occurred in almost all 5-y age classes. Regressions of height and diameter vs. age had high predictability and showed that spruce grew more rapidly than fir. Allometric (height/diameter) relationships differed significantly between species; spruce had a much greater height/diameter ratio than fir. Seedlings accumulate gradually and persist for long periods in the seedling bank, thus forming a large pool of individuals that can potentially respond to opening of the canopy.},

abstract = {The impact of winter harvesting on regeneration 50 years after an experimental diameter-limit cutting was examined in mixed deciduous-coniferous ecosystems of southern Quebec, Canada. The study was conducted in La Mauricie National Park, Quebec, Canada. Regeneration data in two balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) ecosystem types were analyzed. Comparisons between uncut and cut stands were obtained from a total of 63 sample plots. For both ecosystems, there were no significant differences between uncut and cut plots for regeneration density and stocking. The most abundant regeneration species were balsam fir, red spruce, sugar maple, red maple (Acer rubrum L.), yellow birch and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). The type of diameter-limit cutting described in the study did not affect regeneration density and stocking but its impact on productivity, timber quality and genetics is still unknown.

abstract = {The long-term effects of high-intensity diameter-limit cuttings conducted in the winter and summer of the 1940s and 1950s on the dynamics of softwood and mixedwood stands in southeastern Quebec were compared. Changes in composition and stand structure over a 50 year period were studied using 18 permanent sample plots located in the Lac-M{\'{e}}tis Seigneury observation area measured in 1950, 1960, 1970, and 2003. Winter logging operations were conducted between 1942 and 1949, and summer logging operations were conducted between 1958 and 1960. The interaction between cuttings and the 1950s and 1970s spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)) outbreaks that occurred in the area affected forest dynamics. For the two logging operation types, the most abundant softwood species observed before logging and in 2003 was balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), whereas white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) were the most abundant hardwood species. Changes in the overstory composition were more significant in the summer logging operations than in the winter ones. The soft-wood cover type observed before winter logging was maintained in 2003. Following summer logging, an important increase in the proportion of birch species was observed. The softwood cover type observed before logging had changed to a mixedwood cover type by 2003. Forest dynamics differences between the two types of logging were the result of interactions between the density and composition of advance regeneration, the microsite conditions after logging, and the length and severity of spruce budworm outbreaks.

abstract = {Understanding the factors regulating the composition and abundance of natural regeneration in forest ecosystems is critical to sustainable management worldwide. Using a long-term silvicultural experiment in Maine, we partitioned the variation in natural regeneration and examined the contribution of overstory and understory vegetation (biotic factors), substrate and soil attributes (abiotic factors), and silvicultural treatment. We hypothesized that silvicultural treatment (single-tree selection with 5, 10, and 20-year cutting cycles and diameter-limit cutting) would be less influential than abiotic and biotic factors in structuring regeneration pattern. Overall, treatment and site (biotic and abiotic) factors accounted for 26{\%} of the variation in regeneration species composition, highlighting stochasticity of the regeneration process. In support of our hypothesis, regeneration pattern that could be explained was primarily associated with local site factors; overstory and understory vegetation uniquely accounted for 16{\%} of the variation in species composition. Substrate and soil attributes along with silvicultural treatment accounted for 4{\%} of variation, and uniquely accounted for 2{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively. In support of earlier reports, shifts toward hardwood dominance were apparent at early stages of cohort development and were associated with high harvest intensities. Our findings suggested that overstory and understory vegetation exhibit greater control over regeneration patterns than substrate and soil attributes, or silvicultural treatment, in partially harvested Acadian Forest mixedwood stands, and also indicated the potential for composition control through selective overstory removal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The development and maintenance of several types of visually striking vegetation patterns are controlled by positive feedback between pattern and process. These patterns are particularly common at ecotones, where the influence of positive feedback may affect the position and dynamics of the boundary between the adjacent biotic communities. In this study, I use dendrochronology to examine the role of feedback between existing trees and the establishment and survival of seedlings in the advancement of linear, finger-like strips of subalpine forest in Glacier National Park, Montana. A general upslope, windward to leeward pattern of older trees followed by progressively younger trees was evident in all sample transects, although in some cases this pattern repeated several times along the length of a transect, with each repetition originating leeward of boulders. Overall advancement rates varied from 0.28 to 0.62 m yr-1. The oldest trees established in the early to mid-1700s, but establishment and advancement increased rapidly after 1850, and peaked in the early 1900s. In addition, almost all seedlings established within 5 m downwind of existing trees between 1700 and 1850, while establishment beyond this distance was common after 1850. These patterns suggest that existing trees facilitate leeward seedling establishment and survival, by depositing wind-blown snow. These seedlings in turn modify their leeward environment, thus allowing forest advancement in a linear pattern. Feedback was critical for the survival of seedlings before 1800, and strongly controlled advancement between about 1800 and 1850, but appears to have had little effect on establishment patterns since that time. The importance of feedback between pattern and process may change over time and space as a result of changes in climatic conditions or biotic surroundings. {\textcopyright} 2005 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

abstract = {Multi-cohort-based forest management has been proposed as a strategy to conciliate wood supply and biodiversity conservation objectives. At the stand-level, the approach involves using partial harvesting to generate structurally complex stands, notably in terms of tree age, size and species mixtures, conditions that are not easily integrated into yield tables. Using SORTIE-ND, a spatially explicit stand dynamics model, we simulated 100-year development patterns following different partial harvesting treatments in two trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx)-dominated stands in eastern Canada, one 76-year old (pure aspen) and the other 90 years old (mixed aspen). The two stand types differed primarily in the nature of their understory: pure aspen stands had little advance conifer growth and a dense understory of a woody shrub species whereas mixed aspen stands were characterized by a dense regeneration layer of shade-tolerant conifers. To do this, we first evaluated model performance using short (12 years) and long (168 years) term empirical data. We then modelled stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvesting treatments of different intensities (33, 61 and 80{\%} basal area removal), and gap sizes (400, 900 and 1600m2). Following mortality of the first cohort of aspen, simulations projected dominance of conifer species, white spruce in particular, in unharvested controls of pure aspen stands and balsam fir in mixed aspen stands. Aspen recruitment increased with intensity of partial harvesting. All gap treatments and the 80{\%} dispersed harvesting favored recruitment of aspen over conifer species. After 100-year simulation runs, the 1600m2 gap treatment resulted in highest stand basal areas, 38.0 and 34.1m2ha-1, of which 18{\%} and 28{\%} consisted of intermediate- to shade-tolerant conifer species in pure aspen stands and in mixed aspen stands, respectively. Concerns surrounding partial harvesting have tended to focus on absolute retention levels and standing residence times of trees; however, our results demonstrate that both stand structure and timber production rates are influenced not only by retention levels after partial harvesting but also by spatial configuration of the residual trees. We identified several model functions that are likely responsible for divergences between empirical conditions and those simulated by SORTIE-ND for the boreal mixedwood and suggest specific empirical studies to improve parameter functions of this modelling tool.},

Ingrowth, accretion, and mortality of individual trees (≥0.5 in. dbh) are followed on permanent sample plots before and after harvests, and at about 5-year intervals between harvests. Differences in growth between the reference and treated stands and among several of the treatments have been documented. There have also been changes in species composition and stand quality. Over the decades this experiment has yielded valuable answers to questions it was designed to address and insights into many issues that were not anticipated when it was planned.

abstract = {We examined the growth of understory conifers, following partial or complete deciduous canopy removal, in a field study established in two regions in Canada. In central British Columbia, we studied the responses of three species (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss × Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm., and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and in northwestern Quebec, we studied one species (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Stem and root diameter and height growth were measured 5 years before and 3 years after harvesting. Both root and stem diameter growth increased sharply following release but seedlings showed greater root growth, suggesting that in the short term, improvement in soil resource capture and transport, and presumably stability, may be more important than an increase in stem diameter and height growth. Response was strongly size dependent, which appears to reflect greater demand for soil resources as well as higher light levels and greater tree vigour before release for taller individuals. Growth ratios could not explain the faster response generally attributed to true fir species or the unusual swift response of spruces. Good prerelease vigour of spruces, presumably favoured by deciduous canopies, could explain their rapid response to release.

abstract = { The ratio between projected leaf area (LA) and cross-sectional sapwood area (SA) of dominant and codominant balsam fir trees (Abiesbalsamea (L.) Mill.) was determined in 24 forest stands across the province of Quebec. Various physical factors proposed in the Whitehead hydraulic model, and some of the easily measured surrogates of these factors, were tested for their influence on LA:SA ratios. Average growing season vapor pressure deficit, temperature, precipitation, and stand drainage class did not significantly influence LA:SA ratios. On the other hand, LA:SA ratios were positively influenced by sapwood permeability (k), tree height, and crown length. As suggested by the model, there was a positive correlation between sapwood permeability and LA:SA ratio and a negative correlation between tree height or crown length and LA/(SA k). Increases in sapwood permeability with tree age were associated with longer tracheids having larger lumen diameters. Of the various empirical factors tested, only site quality, 5-year basal area growth, and age had a significant influence on LA:SA ratios. Sapwood cross-sectional area at breast height by itself was a reasonable linear predictor of LA for all stands (LA = −0.158 + 0.709 SA BH , R 2 = 0.75). Using the variables that were previously determined to influence LA:SA ratios, stepwise regressions revealed that only crown length and 5-year basal area growth significantly improved linear predictions of LA based on sapwood area. However, the increase in R 2 was relatively modest, i.e., 0.83 for all three independent variables versus 0.75 for SA alone. The results from this study will be useful in integrating physiologically based measurements, such as growth efficiency, into standard forest inventory practices for balsam fir and thus could be beneficial in developing new silvicultural strategies for protecting Quebec's forest resource. },

abstract = {Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term ({\textgreater}50 yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives. As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems , such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity.},

abstract = {The effects of partial cutting on species composition, new and residual-tree cohorts, tree size distribution, and tree growth was evaluated on 73 plots in 18 stands throughout southeast Alaska. These partially cut stands were harvested 12-96 years ago, when 16-96{\%} of the former stand basal area was removed. Partial cutting maintained stand structures similar to uncut old-growth stands, and the cutting had no significant effects on tree species composition. The establishment of new-tree cohorts was positively related to the proportion of basal-area cut. The current stand basal area, tree species composition, and stand growth were significantly related to trees left after harvest (p {\textless} 0.001). Trees that were 20-80 cm dbh at the time of cutting had the greatest tree-diameter and basal-area growth and contributed the most to stand growth. Diameter growth of Sitka spruce and western hemlock was similar, and the proportion of stand basal-area growth between species was consistent for different cutting intensities. Concerns about changing tree species composition, lack of spruce regeneration, and greatly reduced stand growth and vigor with partial cuts were largely unsubstantiated. Silvicultural systems based on partial cutting can provide rapidly growing trees for timber production while maintaining complex stand structures with mixtures of spruce and hemlock trees similar to oldgrowth stands.},

An unharvested control (CON) was monitored for comparison. At the ecophysiological level, we mainly found differences in light-saturated photosynthesis of red spruce and specific leaf area of balsam fir among treatments. Consequently, we observed good height growth of both species in CON and INT, but fir surpassed spruce in SMA and LAR. Results suggest that intermediate 100-300 m2 irregular openings create microenvironmental conditions that may promote short-term ecophysiology and growth of red spruce, allowing the species to compete with balsam fir advance regeneration. Finally, results observed for spruce in large 700-m2 openings confirm its inability to grow as rapidly as fir in comparable open conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {An experiment was established in 1991-1992 in northern British Columbia to investigate factors influencing natural regeneration rates of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) in three stand structures created by harvesting. Harvest treatments were a 32-ha clearcut, 0.2-ha patch cuts, and single-tree selection. Cone crop periodicity was independent of harvesting system. Natural seedfall was higher in the selection treatment and small patch cut than the clearcut treatment every year. Five years after harvest, the selection and patch cut treatments had 7 times as many spruce germinants and 10 times as many subalpine fir germinants as the clearcut treatment. Seed availability appears to be the primary limiting factor for establishment of both subalpine fir and spruce in the clearcut treatment. For spruce establishment in the selection and small patch cut treatments, availability of both seed and mineral soil seedbeds were limiting factors, while for subalpine fir, germinant establishment appears primarily limited by availability of disturbed forest floor seedbeds. Foresters could increase opportunities for natural regeneration in these subalpine forests by (i) modifying harvest patterns to enhance conifer seed distribution over harvested areas and (ii) applying seedbed preparation treatments prior to anticipated heavy seedfalls.

abstract = {The determination of an optimal sequence of diameter distributions and selection harvests for uneven-aged stand management is formulated as a discrete-time optimal-control problem with bounded control variables and free-terminal point. An efficient programming technique utilizing gradients provides solutions that are stable and interpretable on the basis of economic principles. Methods and results are demonstrated using a whole-standdiameter-class simulator developed for northern hardwoods stands in Wisconsin. Examples in which the objective is present net worth maximization over a 150-year planning horizon with a 5-year cutting cycle suggest two types of optimal equilibrium stand structures: a downward-sloping diameter distribution if large value premiums are assigned to the largest diameter classes and a truncated diameter distribution if premiums for larger trees are gradual or absent. Transition strategies vary in length and harvest pattern depending on the stumpage value function used. It is emphasized that equilibrium management regimes developed with static analysis are not optimal when used as starting conditions in dynamic formulations. FOREST SCI. 3 1:45 1 4 6 2. ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS. Forest economics, optimal control theory, gradient projection method, nonlinear programming. THE INCORPORATION of even-aged stand growth and yield simulators into dynamic programming frameworks has improved the economic analysis of silvicultural investment decisions in stand-level even-aged management (Brodie and Kao 1979, Martin and Ek 198 1, Riitters and others 1982). Uneven-aged stand simulators cannot be readily incorporated into dynamic programming frameworks because the large number of decision variables involved would require long computation time and massive computer storage. We introduce a more efficient optimization technique based on optimal control theory and demonstrate its use in finding the optimal sequence of diameter distributions and selection harvests for an uneven-aged stand. The decision variables facing a forest manager interested in applying uneven-aged management at the stand level are (1) the cutting cycle length, and (2) the diameter distribution and species composition after each selection harvest during a given planning horizon. We use the optimization technique to solve the diameter distribution problem, and it can be expanded to analyze both cutting cycle length and species composition problems.},

We hypothesize that this "growth shock" following release results because seedlings are ill adjusted to the new growing conditions and that this can be investigated through a comparison of growth in different parts of the tree over a 6-year period. This study compares the growth response of three size classes of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

Growth was evaluated in four parts of the studied trees: radial increment in roots, in the base of the stem, and in branches, as well as leader height growth extension. Our findings show that following release from the overstory, early growth increases were largest in the roots and stems irrespective of the species or the size class. Differences between the species were observed in greater absolute height growth for pine, whereas Douglas-fir invested in greater stem growth, especially in the larger individuals. Important differences also occurred temporally. Both species (and all size classes) responded with an immediate increase in root growth followed, after a 1-year delay, by an increase in stem growth. Branch radial increment (for pine) and leader height growth (both species), however, experienced 2 to 3 year growth reductions before responding. It is therefore suggested that individuals restore the root-shoot balance by greater initial investments to root growth to offset the increased transpiration losses associated with the greater light and higher temperature conditions and the relative changes in the photosynthetic versus nutrient uptake capacity following the canopy opening. Foresters may therefore be able to manipulate tree growth responses by using an appropriate degree of overstory removal or opening size.},

Branch radial increment (for pine) and leader height growth (both species), however, experienced 2 to 3 year growth reductions before responding. It is therefore suggested that individuals restore the root-shoot balance by greater initial investments to root growth to offset the increased transpiration losses associated with the greater light and higher temperature conditions and the relative changes in the photosynthetic versus nutrient uptake capacity following the canopy opening. Foresters may therefore be able to manipulate tree growth responses by using an appropriate degree of overstory removal or opening size.},

abstract = {A white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) overstory of a 30+ year old stand was thinned or completely removed, releasing an advance regeneration of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt). The overstory was clear-cut (T0), thinned to 600 (T600) or to 1200 (T1200) stems/ha, or left uncut (control). Three years after release, understory responses were best demonstrated by decreasing specific leaf area with increasing release level and by changes to height and radial growth increments. Clear-cutting the overstory stalled the height growth in fir for two seasons and radial growth at the tree base for one season. Compared with the control, the 3-year height increment was proportionally greatest in intermediate trees of T600, and this treatment produced the overall best response in height growth. Complete birch removal produced the best radial growth response despite the initial growth check. However, no release treatment significantly affected the whole tree variables (aboveground biomass, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), live crown ratio) within the studied time frame. Shoot silhouette ratios were lowest in the completely released understory trees, while they were similar to those of the controls in all partial-release treatments. Tree sturdiness (height/DBH ratio) was 80-90 in most treatments except TO, where it declined to below 80. Despite this improvement, large trees in TO have been damaged by wind and snow.},

Fertilization did not affect seedling growth. Furthermore, soil N availability did not vary among harvest treatments. In contrast, clearcut compared with shelterwood seedlings had greater mass (fivefold), light availability (twofold), and soil temperatures (1.6°C). Across harvest treatments, spruce and fir mass increased linearly to 100{\%} open-sky light (R2 = 0.51 and 0.57, respectively), and temperature and light combined explained more variation in mass than light alone (adjusted R2 = 0.58 for both species). Spruce growth was more sensitive to temperature than fir in both field and greenhouse experiments. Diminished growth at low soil temperature was associated with lower photosynthesis and not lower leaf fraction. Thus, soil temperature and light colimit seedling growth in subalpine forests, but responses were species-specific and consistent with microenvironment differences in spruce and fir regeneration niches.},

abstract = {This paper reviews aspects of the functional ecology of naturally established tree seedlings in the boreal forests of North America with an emphasis on the relationship between light availability and the growth and survival of shade tolerant conifers up to pole size. Shade tolerant conifer species such as firs and spruces tend to have a lower specific leaf mass, photosynthetic rate at saturation, live crown ratio, STAR (shoot silhouette area to total needle surface area ratio), and root to shoot ratio than the shade intolerant pines. The inability of intolerant species such as the pines and aspen to survive in shade appears to be mainly the result of characteristics at the shoot, crown, and whole-tree levels and not at the leaf level. Although firs and spruces frequently coexist in shaded understories, they do not have identical growth patterns and crown architectures. We propose a simple framework based on the maximum height that different tree species can sustain in shade, which may help managers determine the timing of partial or complete harvests. Consideration of these functional aspects of regeneration is important to the understanding of boreal forest dynamics and can be useful to forest managers seeking to develop or assess novel silvicultural systems.},

abstract = {Modern forestry has been evolving towards multiple-use of forests and maintenance of biodiversity. Interest in integrating natural forest dynamics into management planning and silvicultural practices has increased as a result of concerns related to biodiversity values and maintaining ecological functions in managed forests. Taking advantage of naturally formed advance regeneration to create a new forest is one way of emulating natural forest dynamics, especially in spruce forests. However, efficient use of advance regeneration requires knowledge about factors influencing their performance. Light is important for growth and for crown, shoot and needle morphology of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Crown morphology varies from a conical and deep crown form in relatively highlight environments to the typical ''umbrella'' form in the understorey shade. Shoots and needles developed in shade are flatter and experience less self-shading than those developed in more light. Needle orientation is horizontal in shade and more vertically inclined in light. The number of nodal and internodal branches increases with increasing light. Tree shoot characteristics are strongly correlated and highly dependent on growing conditions, particularly light. There is a correlation between shoot and needle mass and other shoot variables of current and consecutive year's growth. The strongest correlations are between length of the shoot and needle mass of the shoot, and the length of the shoot and number of needles on the shoot. Needle length was not as sensitive to the light environment. However, needle width and thickness increased with canopy openness. This paper presents a review of selected literature on the relationships between different tree variables and ecophysiological factors that influence the response and acclimation of Norway spruce advance regeneration to release. The results indicate that crown, shoot and needle characteristics could reflect the acclimation to light conditions and indicate the performance of advance regeneration after release.},

abstract = {Understory growth dynamics of northern conifer species were studied in four stands managed under multiaged silvicultural systems in eastern Maine. Height growth of Picea rubens Sarg., Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr. saplings between 0.5 and 6.0 m in height was related to the proportion open sky (POS), using sapling height as a covariate. Height growth of T. canadensis equaled A. balsamea and exceeded P. rubens under very low light levels (POS {\textless} 0.1) but is much less responsive to both increasing POS and taller heights, reaching 50{\%} of its maximum height growth at a POS of only 0.09. Abies balsamea outgrew P. rubens under similar dark conditions; at higher light levels (POS {\textgreater} 0.10), both species grew similarly. Evidently, no feasible overstory manipulation of light alone can promote more rapid height development of P. rubens saplings over A. balsamea. A nonlinear light-prediction model using stand basal area is linked with height-growth prediction equations to quantify sapling development from 0.5 to 6 m. Depending on overstory density, P. rubens requires a height advantage of 0.14-0.33 m over a 0.5 m tall A. balsamea to reach a height of 6 m over the same time period. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of 'variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

Many alternative stocking control approaches have been developed for uneven-aged stands. Four methods are presented that represent a contrast in complexity and emphasis, but that conceptually build on each other. All are assumed to be tools for allocation of growing space. The BDq approach builds on a reverse-J diameter distribution that serves as a target stand structure. The Plenter system is similar to the BDq approach as it uses a diameter distribution to represent stand structure but provides more flexibility for structures with different growth patterns. Stand density index can be allocated among diameter classes to form a variety of structures. Similarly, leaf area index can be allocated among age classes or canopy strata without the constraints of a reverse-J diameter distribution. Other methods for controlling stocking in uneven-aged stands exist and many undoubtedly represent sound approaches to management. The trend in the four approaches described here is towards a better understanding of stand dynamics and greater flexibility for diverse structural goals.},

abstract = {Understanding the response of tree regeneration following commercial thinning treatments can improve planning in managed forests dependent on natural regeneration. We used long-term commercial thinning experiments in eastern spruce-fir stands of Maine, USA, to test two hypotheses: (1) commercial thinning increases the density of tree regeneration and (2) tree regeneration density increases with increasing thinning intensity. A decade after thinning, densities of softwood and hardwood regeneration were 10 times greater in thinned stands than unthinned stands. The abundance of small softwood (0.11-0.60mtall) was highest in lower intensity thinning treatments, whereas medium (0.61-1.40mtall) and large (≥1.41mtall to 8.90 cm diameter at breast height) softwoods increased proportionally with thinning intensity, a pattern related to a higher rate of recruitment in more open stands created by heavier thinning. Hardwood density generally increased with thinning intensity and developed into a significant component of the large size class. Softwood regeneration density was higher in older spruce stands than younger fir stands, which may be due to greater abundance of advance regeneration, higher residual stand mortality, and greater harvest disturbance in older spruce stands. However, acceptable softwood stocking was achieved in all replicates of thinning treatments. Therefore, in addition to providing higher individual-tree growth and merchantable yield, commercial thinning in eastern spruce-fir stands also increases regeneration density. The rate of recruitment also increased as thinning intensity increased, thus stimulating understory regeneration similar to that of a shelterwood establishment cut.},

abstract = {Models for predicting diameter increment in multi-storey spruce stands following mountain forest selective cutting (MFS) were developed. They were based on increment cores, tree ring analyses and stump registrations. The presented models rely upon time series data from 1600 trees in thirty-one Norway spruce stands in south-eastern and central parts of Norway. The selective cuttings were heavy; on average two thirds of the standing volume were cut. The increment following the interventions was highly variable, resulting in large random variability in the models with R2 varying between 0.18-0.31 for individual tree diameter growth and 0.40-0.50 for mean tree stand diameter growth. Dummy variables referring to three first 5-year periods after cutting were found to increase the precision and significantly reduce the random error. Selected models were validated using a test material from central Norway and also compared with the mostly applied Norwegian diameter increment models. Despite a large random variation in all models, the model performances appeared logical and the general fit to the data was acceptable. Based on tests, two diameter increment models are recommended for future yield prognoses in MFS. The models should also be of interest for wider use in other parts of the Nordic and Baltic boreal zone.},

abstract = {On the basis of nine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and ten European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) thinning experiments in Germany, for which both residual and removed stock had been registered first during 1870, I scrutinize how moderate and heavy thinning from below (B-, C-grade) affects the production of merchantable volume compared with light thinning (A-grade). In relation to A-grade, cumulative merchantable volume (CV) of B- and C-grade amounts in average to 103-107{\%} in juvenile and to 97-102{\%} in mature Norway spruce stands. The corresponding findings for European beech are 101-106{\%} and 94-102{\%}. CV of individual stands varies between 89{\%} and 130{\%} for Norway spruce and 73{\%} and 155{\%} for European beech (CV of A-grade = 100{\%}). These findings are substantiated by the relation between stand density (SDI) and periodic annual increment (PAI). On the B- and C-grade plots of spruce and beech, respectively, SDI was reduced down to 41-91{\%} and 31-83{\%} of the A-grade. When SDI is reduced in young stands, PAI follows a unimodal curve. Norway spruce's PAI culminates in 109{\%} if SDI is reduced to 59{\%}; European beech's PAI culminates in 123{\%} when density is reduced to 50{\%}. Whereas Norway spruce's growth reacts most positively on thinning under poor site conditions and with increment reduction on favourable sites, European beech behaves oppositely. With stand development the culmination point of the unimodal relation moves towards maximum density, so that in older stands PAI follows the increasing pattern, which is the left portion of a unimodal curve. A model is presented which apparently unifies contradictory patterns of stand density-growth reactions by integrating relative stand density, average tree size and site fertility effects, and makes the findings operable for forest management. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society of American Foresters. In 1950, the US Forest Service initiated a cutting practice level (CPL) study on the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine on the basis of findings of a national appraisal of forestland management. Silvicultural treatments, including the selection system with 5- and 15-year cutting cycles, fixed diameter-limit cutting, and variants of commercial clearcutting, were chosen to represent "High-order," "Good," "Fair," and "Poor" cutting practices as then defined for eastern spruce-fir (Picea-Abies; northern conifer) forests. After 60 years, selection treatments have maintained a wide distribution of tree sizes, increased the proportion of mature spruce, and decreased the proportion of hardwoods; selection cutting on a 15-year cycle resulted in the highest current stand value. Fixed diameter-limit cutting resulted in the greatest harvest revenue but degraded residual stand composition, structure, and value. Outcomes of commercial clearcutting varied as a function of treatment (none, repeated harvest, or rehabilitation) after the first harvest. After 60 years, the proportion of acceptable growing stock was highest in selection and rehabilitation treatments and lowest in fixed diameter-limit and commercial clearcut treatments. Findings confirm that long-term outcomes of silvicultural treatments with attention to residual stand condition surpass those managed for short-term financial gains with regard to residual stand structure, value, and quality.},

abstract = {Using inventory data from a long-term silviculture experiment in east-central Maine, spatial models were developed to analyze 28 years (1974-2002) of stand structural dynamics. Differences in spatial pattern, species mingling, height differentiation, and relative stand complexity index (rSCI) were compared among five treatments: commercial clear-cutting, fixed diameter-limit, 5 year single-tree selection, three-stage shelterwood (both with and without precommercial thinning), and unharvested natural areas. Regardless of treatment, regeneration events (whether induced by natural breakup of the overstory or by harvesting) increased aggregation in spatial pattern and reduced species mingling, more so in the commercial clearcut and fixed diameter-limit treatments where hardwood densities were highest. Regular spatial patterns were rare. Height differentiation values for individual trees and stand-level mean rSCI were generally highest in untreated natural areas and 5 year selection treatments, intermediate in commercial clearcut and fixed diameter-limit treatments, and lowest in three-stage shelterwood treatments. After a brief adjustment period, precommercial thinning in a shelterwood treated stand generally increased species mingling, height differentiation, and rSCI. Two untreated natural areas exhibited divergent pathways of structural development. Dynamics in uneven-aged selection treatments more closely resembled that of the untreated natural areas than did the shelterwood, commercial clearcut, or fixed diameter limit treatments.

abstract = {This long-term experiment in Maine, U.S.A., was designed to provide information on the best silvicultural practices for managing stands of mixed northern conifers in northeastern U.S.A. We evaluated growth and yield and changes in species composition, quality, and structure during the first 40 years of the experiment. Replicated treatments include the selection system, uniform shelterwood, unregulated harvesting, and diameter-limit cutting. The new cohort established under three-stage shelterwood was subsequently left untreated or precommercially thinned. Between-treatment differences in net volume growth were not significant (?? = 0.10), though gross volume growth differed significantly for managed vs. unmanaged, selection vs. shelterwood, and shelterwood vs. diameter-limit treatments. A three-stage shelterwood method with precommercial thinning 10 years following final overstory removal resulted in good control of hardwoods and hemlock and a dramatic increase in spruce and fir. The selection system on a 5-year cutting cycle resulted in increased hemlock, spruce, and fir, with a decrease in hardwood species. If the primary goal were production, even-aged management would most likely be preferred. We recommend a two-stage shelterwood method as applied in this experiment with some modification to improve species composition and stand quality. Stand quality (proportion of stand volume in cull trees) and species composition was influenced by treatment.},

@article{Thorpe2007,
abstract = {In the past 10 to 15 years, alternative silvicultural treatments involving partial harvesting have been developed for boreal forests, with the goal of achieving a balance between biodiversity maintenance and continued timber production. Most prior research has focussed on the impacts of partial harvesting on biological diversity, while stand dynamic responses remain little studied. In this paper we explore partial stand harvesting in the Canadian boreal - its rationale, current extent, and impact on stand dynamic patterns. Empirical studies from the boreal and elsewhere indicate that residual trees of many species respond to partial harvesting with enhanced growth, commonly showing a lagged response after which peak growth occurs five to 25 years following harvest. Post-harvest mortality is also prevalent but much more variable, with losses of residual trees ranging from nearly zero to more than 50{\%} above background mortality rates in the initial years following harvest. With the exception of strip cutting in parts of northern Ontario and Quebec (HARP/CPPTM), operational partial harvesting in the Canadian boreal currently involves very low levels of retention. Available data suggest that such low retention levels, particularly when spatially dispersed, generally result in unacceptably high rates of post-harvest mortality, which are unlikely to be offset by increases in residual tree growth. There is an urgent need for development of spatially explicit stand simulation models that will allow accurate yield predictions for partial harvest systems to assess their feasibility in boreal forest management.},

abstract = {Dendroctonus rufipennis outbreaks are important disturbances affecting subalpine forests of Engelmann spruce Picea engelmannii, subalpine fir Abies lasiocarpa and lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in the S Rocky Mountains. In subalpine forests in Colorado, an outbreak in the 1940s caused a shift in dominance from spruce to fir and a reduction in average and maximum tree diameters, heights and ages. The outbreak did not favor new seedling establishment of the seral lodgepole pine. Thus, in seral stands spruce beetle outbreak accelerates succession towards the shade-tolerant tree species. The predominant response to the outbreak was release of previously suppressed small-diameter spruce (not attacked by the beetle) and subalpine fir (a non-host species). Growth rates of released trees remained high for {\textgreater}40 yr. Both spruce and fir will continue to codominate the affected stands. -from Authors},

abstract = {A white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) overstory of a 30+ year old stand was thinned or completely removed , releasing an advance regeneration of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.). The overstory was clear-cut (T0), thinned to 600 (T600) or to 1200 (T1200) stems/ha, or left uncut (control). Three years after release, understory responses were best demonstrated by decreasing specific leaf area with increasing release level and by changes to height and radial growth increments. Clear-cutting the overstory stalled the height growth in fir for two seasons and radial growth at the tree base for one season. Compared with the control, the 3-year height increment was proportionally greatest in intermediate trees of T600, and this treatment produced the overall best response in height growth. Complete birch removal produced the best radial growth response despite the initial growth check. However, no release treatment significantly affected the whole tree variables (aboveground biomass, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), live crown ratio) within the studied time frame. Shoot silhouette ratios were lowest in the completely released understory trees, while they were similar to those of the controls in all partial-release treatments. Tree sturdiness (height/DBH ratio) was 80-90 in most treatments except T0, where it declined to below 80. Despite this improvement, large trees in T0 have been damaged by wind and snow.
